Introduction
Disparities in the burden of cancer by socioeconomic position (SEP), race and ethnicity are well documented in the United States [1]–[3]. The relationships between socio-demographic characteristics and cancer outcomes are complex, and disparities have been documented across the disease continuum from stage at diagnosis, access to high-quality care, prognosis, and mortality. In this paper, we focus on understanding the factors that influence patient selection of where they receive their cancer care, and how these processes vary by race and SEP.
Within the field of oncology, a growing body of research reveals that the settings where patients receive cancer care has implications for patients’ outcomes [4]–[7]. Previous research shows that patients from low SEP and African American cancer patients are less likely to receive optimal treatment such as surgery and chemotherapy for many major cancers, and are less likely to receive their care at National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centers (NCI-CCC) [8]–[12]. Cancer patients treated at institutions offering clinical treatment studies and performing a high volume of specialized care and surgeries for cancer tend to have better outcomes and fewer complications than patients treated in community hospitals with less expertise in specialized procedures [6], [13]. Additionally, patients receiving care at an NCI-CCC have significantly lower odds of mortality [7],[14]–[17]. Research has also shown that outcome disparities between African American and white patients are reduced when patients receive their care at an NCI-CCC [5]. These previous findings have focused attention on increasing access to care at NCI-CCCs for minority and underserved patients, specifically through identification and reduction of barriers to care [4], [7]. To this end, greater understanding is needed about the factors that influence patient selection of where they receive their cancer care.
In response to the evidence that access to, and type of, hospital may play an important role in cancer outcome disparities, various practice and policy changes have been developed to increase access to high quality care [18]–[20]. For example, NIH’s Revitalization Act of 1993 requires the inclusion of minorities and women by investigators conducting clinical studies [21]. This requirement supports inclusion and representation of all groups in NIH funded research by encouraging equal access to all therapeutic advances. Despite such initiatives, efforts to increase patient diversity have had mixed success [18], [19], [22], and social scientists have identified need to address political and structural inequalities in the general health care system, rather than focus on what may be termed “recruitmentology”, or reductionist attempts to include underrepresented racial/ethnic groups [23], [24]. While the need to increase diversity in patient populations at NCI-CCCs has been identified as a priority, there is an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence patient selection of where they receive their cancer care. Understanding patients’ pathways to care, and how these pathways vary by race and socioeconomic position, will foster development of interventions that increase minority patients’ access to NCI-CCCs.
This study used a mixed-methods approach to examine the associations between patient sociodemographic characteristics and the factors that influenced patients’ cancer care-seeking pathways to one NCI-CCC. The NCI-CCC where data were collected accepts all patients regardless of insurance status or ability to pay for care, removing these potential barriers to care for cancer patients within the catchment area from which we drew our sample. Using data from in-depth qualitative interviews, we analyzed patients’ narratives of their decision-making processes to gain nuanced insight into patients’ experiences and roles in deciding where to receive their cancer care. To examine if these processes varied by race, income, and education we then quantitatively examined the association between demographic characteristics and the factors that shaped patients’ decisions to seek their cancer care at the NCI-CCC (e.g. physician recommendation, media advertising, and advice from social networks).
