Introduction
A foremost aspiration in neuroscience is understanding the connectivity of the human brain. Recent years have seen considerable growth of interest in the human connectome, the effort to map the entire connectivity of the human brain. The analysis of this high-dimensional connectivity data presents a particularly challenging problem. The emerging field of connectomics has risen to meet this challenge, leveraging new advances in graph theory to understand human brain function and leading to the development of multi-institution initiatives such as the Human Connectome project [1].
The field of connectomics began with work on the C. Elegans, a roundworm whose neural connectivity was completely characterized, creating a network with 302 neurons [2]. In a seminal discovery about the complex organization of graphs, the nervous system of C. Elegans as well as other complex networks from numerous domains were shown to exhibit small-world organization [3]. Graph theoretical approaches lending new insight to the dynamics of complex networks began to proliferate, including in the study of social networks, the internet, and food webs [4].
More recently, the study of complex brain networks by analysis of graph theoretical properties has become exceptionally popular. In addition to small-world organization, whole brain networks have shown various nontrivial properties, including scale-free distribution [5], rich-club organization [6] and the hierarchical organization of networks on multiple scales [7], [8].
Graph theory has led to insights on clinical populations. In epilepsy, small world organization is reduced during ictal activity compared to interictal activity [9], and also reduced at rest compared to healthy controls [10], The default mode network in epilepsy patients also shows altered structural connectivity compared to healthy controls [11], [12]. Whole brain networks have also demonstrated applications to schizophrenia [13], [14], Alzheimer's disease [15], attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder [16], and personality traits [17].
Mapping the human connectome non-invasively is currently being pursued using multiple imaging technologies. Connectomics has focused most closely on resting state fMRI [18] and diffusion MRI [19]. However, network studies of resting state electrophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which directly measure neural currents at high temporal resolution [20]â€“[22], as well as networks derived from cortical thickness measurements [23], have also been used. Many different analysis techniques exist to estimate connectivity in the brain in each of these modalities.
In order to map the human connectome, sophisticated visualization and analysis tools are required. A wide variety of free and open source software packages for the analysis of neuroimaging connectivity data are readily available. Most software packages currently available are integrated brain network tools that are designed for processing a single imaging modality Such packages include Camino [24], MNE [25], [26], dipy [27], Brainstorm [28], the Connectome Mapper [29], the MR Connectome Analysis Pipeline [30] and many other unpublished packages. As these packages are typically specialized for processing a particular modality, they have only limited visualization features, and are not necessarily designed to analyze multi-modal data.
There are a number of software packages designed for the visualization and analysis of domain-general complex networks, such as Pajek [31] and Gephi [32]. Notably, there are several software packages specially designed for visualization and analysis of the human connectome: the Connectome Viewer [33], the BrainNet Viewer [34], and the VisualConnectome toolbox (http://code.google.com/p/visualconnectome). Building on visualization features from these packages, we sought to provide new interactive features for the visualization of structural and functional connectivity, and make visualization a more interactive process.
Here, we introduce a general-purpose, free, and open source software package written in python specially designed for the visualization of multi-modal human brain networks: the Connectome Visualization Utility (CVU). CVU is a standalone application with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that automatically generates powerful, interactive visualizations of human brain networks from common matrix and imaging file formats. It is decoupled from the process of connectivity estimation and network creation, and can therefore be easily used to visualize networks from any imaging modality. CVU is designed with the visualization of complex graph theoretical properties in mind and allows network statistics to be easily incorporated into the visualization.
In this manuscript, we describe the features, usage, implementation and software dependencies of CVU. We illustrate the power of CVU's visualizations with example networks constructed from data from the Human Connectome Project. In the following section, we will briefly review the practice and findings of network analysis of human brain networks. As CVU is a visualization tool that requires a fully formed network as input, we will describe some schemes for creating brain networks and provide a limited review of other software packages that perform the network construction and can be used alongside CVU. Finally, we will review the advantages and limitations of CVU, and describe possible future directions for research.
