Introduction
The analysis of boundary layer flow and heat transfer of an incompressible fluid across a stretching sheet has gained attention of many researchers. Nowadays, a large amount of work has been placed to focus on this topic in view of its several applications in engineering and industrial processes. The cooling of electronic devices by the fan and nuclear reactor, polymer extrusion, wire drawing, etc are examples of such flows in engineering and industrial processes. The list of importance of flows in fluid mechanics has motivated researchers to continue the study in different types of fluid as well as in different physical aspects.
The study of flow over a stretching sheet was pioneered by Crane [1] who solved analytically the steady two-dimensional flow past a linearly stretching plate. This problem was later extended by Wang [2] to three-dimensional case. Since then many researchers have investigated various aspects of this type of flow such as Ibrahim and Shankar [3], Roşca and Pop [4], Nandy and Mahapatra [5], Kumaran et al. [6], Turkyilmazoglu [7], Ishak et al. [8]–[10], Yacob et al. [11] and Hussain et al. [12], among others. They have studied the fluid flow and some characteristics of heat transfer towards a stretching sheet in the presence of magnetic field, slip effect, convective boundary conditions, suction/injection, viscous dissipation, radiation effect and heat generation/absorption considering different types of fluid such as nanofluid, viscoelastic fluid and micropolar fluid.
In a continuation study of flow over a stretching sheet, considerable interest has been placed on fluid flow over a shrinking sheet. The study of viscous flow over a shrinking sheet with suction effect at the boundary was first investigated by Miklavčič and Wang [13]. Following this pioneering work, many papers on this topic have been published. For such problem, the movement of the sheet is in the opposite direction to that of the stretching case, and thus the flow moves towards a slot. Goldstein [14] has described the shrinking flow which is basically a backward flow. Vorticity of the shrinking sheet is not confined within a boundary layer, and the flow is unlikely to exist unless adequate suction on the boundary is imposed (Miklavčič and Wang [13]).
The “nanofluid” term was first introduced by Choi [15] to describe the mixture of nanoparticles and base fluid such as water and oil. The addition of nanoparticle into the base fluid is able to change the transport properties, flow and heat transfer capability of the liquids and indirectly increase the low thermal conductivity of the base fluid which is identified as the main obstacle in heat transfer performance. This mixture has attracted the interest of numerous researchers because of its many significant applications such as in the medical applications, transportations, microelectronics, chemical engineering, aerospace and manufacturing (Li et al. [16]). A comprehensive literature review on nanofluids has been given by Li et al. [16], Kakaç and Pramuanjaroenkij [17], Wong and De Leon [18], Saidur et al. [19], Fan and Wang [20], Jaluria et al. [21], and most recently by Mahian et al. [22]. These papers are based on the mathematical nanofluid models proposed by Khanafer [23], and Tiwari and Das [24] for the two-phase mixture containing micro-sized particles. On the other hand, one should also mention the mathematical nanofluid model proposed by Buongiorno [25] used in many papers pioneered by Nield and Kuznetsov [26], and Kuznetsov and Nield [27] for the free convection boundary layer flow along a vertical flat plate embedded in a porous medium or in a viscous fluid. In this model, the Brownian motion and thermophoresis enter to produce their effects directly into the equations expressing the conservation of energy and nanoparticles, so that the temperature and the particle density are coupled in a particular way, and that results in the thermal and concentration buoyancy effects being coupled in the same way. We also mention here the recently published papers by Rashidi et al. [28]–[30] for the nano boundary-layers over stretching surfaces, entropy generation in a steady MHD flow due to a rotating disk in a nanofluid and on the comparative numerical study of single and two phase models of nanofluid heat transfer in wavy channel.
In the present study, we aim to investigate the problem of fluid flow due to a permeable stretching/shrinking sheet in a nanofluid. The present work is based on the nanofluid model introduced by Buongiorno [25], with the new boundary condition which was very recently proposed by Kuznetsov and Nield [31], [32] and Nield and Kuznetsov [33], [34]. As it was explained in [31], the major limitation of the model used by Nield and Kuznetsov [26] was active control of nanoparticle volume fraction at the boundary. The revised model [31]–[34] has been proposed and extended it to the case when the nanofluid particle fraction on the boundary is passively rather than actively controlled. The numerical results are tabulated and shown graphically to illustrate the influence of the suction parameter and the stretching/shrinking parameter on the velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number. It is found that the solutions of the ordinary (similarity) differential equations have multiple (dual) solutions in a certain range of the governing parameters.
