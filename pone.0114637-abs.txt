Introduction
Two evolutionary events make influenza A viruses hard to control: antigenic drift due to mutation and antigenic shift generated from reassortment which occurs when two different influenza A viruses co-infect a host cell. Mutations, which cause relatively small but frequent changes in antigenicity of virus strains, are responsible for the seasonal influenza epidemics. Vaccines used to control seasonal flu must be reviewed twice each year in anticipation of the upcoming winter influenza season [1]. Because the vaccine only provides partial protection and was so far generally employed in an at-risk strategy, which therefore achieves only a minimal reduction in transmission in a population, influenza A viruses still cause much morbidity and mortality. Reassortment can lead to dramatic changes in the viral phenotype and is responsible for at least the three of the last four pandemics in humans in the 20th and 21st centuries [2], [3]. Reassortment events that produced pandemic strains in 1957 and 1968 likely occurred in people (e.g., [4], [5], [6]), but in 2009 reassortment was presumed to occur in pigs [7]; a recent study [8] infers that the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus arose via reassortment between a pre-existing human H1 virus and an avian virus. Even though not as common as mutations, accumulated data suggest that it is much more frequent than was thought before [3], [9], [10], [11], [12]. From limited data sources we estimated that the average rate of reassortment is roughly 10−5 per coinfection per day [13].
In some instances, a reassortant virus can have high pathogenicity in animals and humans. The exchange of genes between pairs of influenza A virus subtypes increased virulence in animal models, including reassortment between subtypes H9N2 and H1N1, between H5N1 and H1N1, and between H3N2 and H5N1 [14], [15]. Reassortment events have historically introduced antigenically distinct subtypes for which there has been little previous infection and little cross-protection acquired from contemporary vaccine formulations. In 1957, reassortment between an avian H2N2 and the circulating H1N1 viruses precipitated an H2N2 pandemic [16]. The virus underwent further reassortment with an avian H3 virus to generate the H3N2 pandemic in 1968 [17]. The pandemic strains were more pathogenic than previously circulating seasonal influenza strains, and each of these pandemics is estimated to have killed in excess of one million people [4], [5]. A reassortant virus may also have high transmissibility within animal models [14], [15] and within humans. Whilst co-circulating with either seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 strains, the A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was able to outcompete these strains and become the dominant transmissible virus for two years [18]. Following the emergence of the A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, the circulating seasonal H1N1 strains were replaced in the human reservoir within a year. A similar phenomenon has been seen following the introduction of other pandemic virus strains into humans, whereby the new pandemic strain replaced a previously circulating subtype (reviewed by [19]).
Since pandemic influenza is caused by a novel strain, a delay of around 6 months is to be expected until vaccine starts to become available due to the time taken for the various manufacturing steps (e.g. [20], [21], [22]). Seasonal influenza vaccines may offer no direct protection, but they are used to reduce the prevalence of circulating strains and therefore that of their coinfection. As the generation of reassortant strains depends on coinfections of different influenza A viruses, it is natural to ask how a vaccination programme for seasonal influenza in humans might affect the chance of novel pandemic strain emergence via reassortment and the attack rate once it emerges.
Studies from animal models show that infection with influenza A viruses can induce partial heterosubtypic immunity and empirical analyses also indicate that immunity acquired from natural infection in humans can also partially protect the patients against other strains [21], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. For example, Cowling et al. [26] have found that those infected with seasonal influenza A during the 2008–2009 season in Hong Kong had a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) pdm09 infection. Our recent theoretical investigations show that cross-immunity induced by natural infection can greatly reduce the opportunity for pandemic emergence [13].
Two different types of seasonal influenza vaccines are available: inactivated and live attenuated. Both are safe and effective in inducing protective antibody responses against matching seasonal strains of influenza, but only live attenuated vaccines can induce heterosubtypic immunity [21], [29], [30], [31], [32]. For example, live attenuated vaccines in animals induce broad protective immune responses [33], [34] and their use in humans has also shown to induce CD4+, CD8+, and γδ T cells relevant for broadly protective heterosubtypic immunity [32]. Such vaccines have been used for some time in North America and have now recently been introduced into Europe, including in the UK as part of a new universal childhood influenza immunisation programme. Nevertheless, whether vaccination for seasonal influenza can provide any protection against pandemic strains is controversial. Katz et al. [35] show that vaccination with both types of seasonal influenza vaccines during 2005–2009 seasons was unlikely to provide protection against the A(H1N1) pdm09 infection. However, a systematic review by Yin et al. [28] suggests that trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) provided moderate cross-protection against laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) pdm09 illness. Whereas, Skowronski et al. [36] found that previous vaccinations for seasonal influenza increase the risk of pandemic infection in 2009, which is unlikely to be explained by an unmeasured confounder [37]. Thus seasonal influenza vaccination may generate at most weak heterosubtypic immunity compared to that induced by natural infection [38]. In view of this, effective vaccination of children against seasonal influenza A viruses might prevent the induction of heterosubtypic immunity by natural infection [39], which might provide one explanation why seasonal influenza vaccination appeared as an increased risk of pandemic infection [36]. The presence or absence of heterosubtypic immunity does not matter under normal circumstances, but might make big differences in the context of a pandemic caused by reassortment, or zoonotic infection of viruses from another species such as avian H5N1 [39] and H7N9 [40].
There is a strong case to be made for the development of cross-reactive vaccines that induce immunity against different subtypes of influenza, different strains of the same subtypes (broad-spectrum protection) to control seasonal and pandemic influenza [22]. Traditional vaccines target surface proteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are specific and always changing so different vaccines have to develop every year. The core of the influenza virus (i.e. the non-glycoproteins) are highly conserved between influenza A virus strains. It is suggested that vaccines that target at highly stable viral gene products such as M2 protein and/or CD8 T cell will elicit cross-reactive antibody and thus heterosubtypic immunity [22], [24], [41], [42], [43]. Development of universal influenza vaccines is one focus of pandemic influenza preparedness, and it is expected that within a decade universal vaccines will become available. The very relevant question is: how effective will these 'universal' vaccines be in controlling the emergence of pandemic influenza via reassortment?
To answer the above questions, in this study we extend our previous population dynamics model of pandemic emergence via reassortment [13] by including seasonal influenza vaccination in the model. We assume two different strains of influenza A virus co-circulate within a human population. Variants introduced by mutation are considered as being identical to their parental strains and thus ignored, with the effect of antigenic drift being reflected in the loss of immunity (cf., [44]). The novel strain is generated only through reassortment from coinfections within a human population, which may mimic what happened in 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics (e.g., [4], [5], [6]). Because of stochastic behaviour when a novel strain first emerges, we use a stochastic approach to examine the influence of vaccination on the emergence of a pandemic strain via reassortment, and on the number of people infected with the pandemic strain once the pandemic emerges. To test the wide range of immunity response from vaccination and natural infection, differing levels of hetero-subtypic immunity will be considered.
