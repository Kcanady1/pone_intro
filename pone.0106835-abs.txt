Introduction
Surfactant replacement therapy is a routine clinical practice for the prevention and treatment of infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [1]. Nevertheless, the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, which are directly linked to lung injury and chronic lung disease [2], [3], represent a serious drawback at the time of initiating surfactant therapy. Therefore, the current trend in neonatology is towards the use of non-invasive respiratory support as a first line treatment for RDS [4], only indicating selective surfactant therapy in the cases that the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not effective enough. The beneficial effects of surfactant therapy have been shown to be maximized, however, if the therapy is applied early in the course of the disease [5], [6] and, hence for years, a method has been sought to administer surfactant during CPAP [7]–[9]. Likewise, tracheal intubation of patients is essential during partial liquid ventilation (PLV) [10] to proceed with perfluorocarbon (PFC) instillation, which together with the lack of success of PLV in the last acute RDS trial conducted in adults [11], represents a major disincentive to its clinical use in preterm infants.
Aerosol delivery in combination with CPAP holds potential to deliver surfactant or PFC with minimal manipulation of the airway and with less extensive hemodynamic changes due to the delivery being gradual [12], [13]. However, although the therapy has been considered to be safe, clinical studies to date on aerosolized surfactant remain inconclusive [7], [9], [14], [15]. Generally, therapeutic aerosols are generated extracorporeally and then aerosol particles have to be carried into the lungs by the inspiratory airflow, which favors upper airway deposition and significantly reduces the amount of aerosol reaching the distal lung. In preterm infants, these difficulties are compounded by their extremely low lung volumes, narrow airways (especially in disease states) and high respiratory rates [16]. In this regard, lung deposition fractions of less than 1% of the nominal dose have been reported during aerosol delivery to preterm neonates [17], [18]. Furthermore, the biophysical characteristics of the liquid compounds significantly affect the performance of the aerosol devices [19]. For instance, clinical surfactant preparations, which contain lipids and proteins, have a high viscosity and, therefore, long aerosolization pulses are required.
Intracorporeal aerosol delivery of surfactant and PFCs, on the other hand, has been shown to improve lung function to the same extent, or even further, than their tracheal instillation, likely due to increased lung deposition [20], [21]. These experimental studies, however, were performed in intubated animals, with the particle generating device, an intracorporeal inhalation catheter (IC), inserted into the endotracheal tube and its aerosol generating tip placed at the distal end, at the carina.
We hypothesize that with this type of system, an intracorporeal, yet non-invasive, surfactant or PFC aerosol could be generated in combination with nasopharyngeal CPAP, for instance. To explore this, we designed the present in vitro feasibility study in which we investigated: 1) variations in the aerosol production rate of surfactant and PFCs and their particle size distribution at different driving pressures (4–6 bar), 2) the lung deposition of surfactant and PFC aerosols in a polymer-based 3D model of the upper conducting airways of an infant, and 3) the air flow rate produced by the IC and the pressure the system contributed to pre-set CPAP, with a view to its potential clinical application in combination with non-invasive respiratory support.
