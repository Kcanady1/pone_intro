Introduction
It is well accepted that cellular hypoxia [1]–[4] triggers a constellation of biological responses involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional events [5], [6] through activation of cellular oxygen sensors. This includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Yet, current knowledge on the quantitative relationships between mitochondrial Po2 (), hypoxia-induced cellular events, and on the release of ROS from the inner mitochondrial membrane, is minimal. For example, how low  must be to trigger abnormally high ROS generation has not yet been identified. Furthermore, the levels of  at rest and during exercise are unknown, although myoglobin-associated Po2 has been measured in intact exercising humans [7], [8], and is reported to be 3–4 mm Hg, implying that  is likely even lower. There are promising new approaches being developed to in vivo assessment of  [9].
Recently, we extended a prior model describing O2 transport from the air to the mitochondria as an integrated system limiting maximal oxygen uptake  [10], [11] to also include the contribution to overall impedance to O2 flow from the above-zero  required to drive mitochondrial respiration [12]. This was accomplished by including an equation for the hyperbolic relationship between mitochondrial Po2 and mitochondrial  as shown by Wilson et al. [13] and confirmed more recently by Gnaiger's group [14], [15]. This has enabled the prediction of  as a balance between the capacities for muscle O2 transport and utilization [12], [16]. In addition, we have expanded this model by now allowing for functional heterogeneity in both lungs and muscle [16], which had previously (and reasonably) been taken to be negligible in health. This was done to enable application to disease states. Since mitochondrial ROS generation is affected by cellular oxygenation, this integrative model may afford the opportunity for better understanding the quantitative relationship between O2 transport, mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation, provided we have an understanding of the relationship between  and ROS formation.
Recent modeling and experimental studies on mitochondrial ROS production under hypoxia and re-oxygenation [17]–[19] have proposed an inherent bi-stability of Complex III, i.e. coexistence of two different steady states at the same external conditions: one state corresponding to low ROS production, and a second potentially dangerous state with high ROS production. Temporary deprivation of oxygen could switch the system from low to high ROS production, thus explaining the damaging effects of hypoxia-re-oxygenation. This recently proposed model provides a conceptual basis for the abnormally high ROS production observed both in hyperoxia [20], [21] and hypoxia [1]–[4] and has the ability to predict the quantitative relationship between ROS generation and .
In this paper, we build upon these previous but separate models of O2 transport as a physiological system and mitochondrial metabolism as a biochemical system, and have linked them through their common variables,  and , establishing one integrated model to predict  and mitochondrial ROS production. Specifically, we integrate the physiological model of the oxygen pathway predicting  from the balance between O2 transport and mitochondrial O2 utilization [10]–[12], [16] with the model of electron and proton transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the ROS production associated with this transport [17]–[19], thereby predicting the rate of ROS production as a function of  and . The former model is referred to below as the O2 pathway model, and the latter as the mitochondrial ROS prediction model.
In addition to describing the integrated modeling system, we present estimates of ROS generation in exercising muscle of healthy subjects at different altitudes at and above sea level using O2 transport data from Operation Everest II [22] and published mitochondrial kinetic data in normal human muscle (discussed in [17]). We found that at sea level, O2 transport at maximal exercise is sufficient to keep  high enough that mitochondrial ROS generation is not significantly increased. However, exercise at high altitude is predicted to significantly increasing ROS generation, agreeing with experimental data collected under these conditions [23]–[25].
