Introduction
A recent work has studied the global structure of ownership network with respect to the issue of the corporate control [1]. In this paper, instead, we carry out an in-depth community analysis [2] of the same network, in order to address questions concerning the level of geographical integration and the role of the financial sector in the global economy. To our knowledge this is the first investigation of communities in large-scale economic networks.
An economic network is a structure in which some economic actors, represented as nodes, are connected to some other actors by means of relationships of several types. Previous empirical studies in socio-economic networks, that are relevant for our work, include those focusing on: international trade [3], [4], international financial exposures [5], [6] and financial networks [7]–[13]. More in detail, previous works on networks relevant to corporate governance include: (i) those on corporate boards, e.g., interlocking directorates [14]–[16], and those on firm ownership [1], [17]–[20]. In general, little attention has been devoted to the community structure of economic networks, with the remarkable exception of [21], [22]. Apart from the study of [23] on the Italian corporate board and ownership networks, the other community analyses have focused so far on correlation networks in stock markets [24] and in foreign exchange markets [25].
Our study of the transnational corporation (TNC) ownership network reveals that the majority of the corporations take part in the largest connected component but at the same time display a pronounced organization in communities. Only few algorithms in the literature are suitable to the investigation of large networks without imposing constraints on the number of communities [26]. We first perform the community analysis by applying the method of [27] (hereafter, Louvain method) and we further apply the method of the hierarchical map equation [28] (hereafter, Infomap method). In order to asses the robustness of the resulting community partitions, we compare the community structure in the empirical network with the one obtained from a random link formation process, accounting for the constraints on the degree distribution and on the ownership structure [18], [29], [30]. The comparison reveals that for the rewired networks the community structure is quite homogeneous across realizations and differs considerably from the one of the empirical network. This means that the community structure cannot be considered the result of a random pattern of link formation. Furthermore, we find that firms in the same community tend to share similar geographical location and industrial sector classification. However, the country dominance tends to be more pronounced than the sector dominance. These results are replicated when a different community detection method is applied. Indeed, the communities identified by the [28] algorithm, Infomap hereafter, which is based on a flow and information theoretic clustering method, maintain the geographical and sector properties.
Finally, we consider communities as themselves forming a meta-network [31], in which the link between any two given communities reflects the number of ownership relations among firms from the two communities. We assess the importance of each community in the network by using DebtRank, a centrality measure recently introduced in the complex networks literature in the context of economics [9]. In particular, we apply this method to verify whether the financial sector is a major source of connection among different communities. We find that the community centrality and, thus the potential impact that each community has on the others, changes drastically when we exclude from the sample the firms belonging to the financial sector. Such a difference in centrality quantifies the role played by the financial sector in linking communities of firms characterized by different geographic location and industrial sector.
