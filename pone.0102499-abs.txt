Introduction
Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive type of brain cancer with the median survival time of approximately one year [1], [2]. It is characterized by rapid proliferation and high invasion. Glioma are resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and eventually recurs [3]. Oncolytic viruses (OV) are genetically manipulated viruses that can destroy cancer cells but do minimal damage to normal healthy tissues [4]. These viruses can preferentially replicate in tumor cells, leading to their lytic destruction. Accompanying cell lysis the virus particles burst out and proceed to spread and infect other cancer cells. While the world's first OV, H101 (Oncorine, an OV functionally identical to ONYX-015), was approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory approval of OVs in the United States and Europe is pending the results of randomized and large phase III studies [5]. Despite the great potential and regulatory approval of OV for clinical use in China, its inefficient dispersal property within the tumor ECM has been recognized as a major barrier for its anti-tumor efficacy [5]. Tumor ECM plays a pivotal role in inhibiting virus spread [6]–[11] and leads to limited viral replication and reduced cytolytic efficacy [12]. Major ECM components blocking this viral dispersal in the neural ECM include hyaluronic acid (HA) [13], [14] and proteoglycans [11], [14] and these structural components are also known for hindering large therapeutic molecules [11].
The use of ECM degradating enzymes could significantly increase the efficacy of OV treatment by enabling virus to move more freely among uninfected tumor cells. Unlike ECM in normal tissue, tumor ECM continuously undergoes remodeling and extensive synthesis [15]–[17]. ECM remodeling is also an important part of brain tumor angiogenesis [18], [19]. The brain ECM contains mainly macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) with a smaller fraction of fibrillary glycoproteins such as collagens, fibronectin, or elastin [14], [19], [20]. Tumor ECM inhibits penetration of anti-tumor agents, leading to low therapeutic efficacy. High interstitial fluid pressure inhibits delivery of the agents by convection through the tumor interstitial matrix resulting in a rather passive diffusion as the major mode of transport of macromolecules [21], [22]. Tumor penetration of macromolecules such as IgG is negatively correlated with increased collagen content [21], [23]. Use of collagenase, an enzyme that breaks the peptide bonds in collagen, was shown to increase the diffusivity of macromolecules (IgG) [23], to reduce interstitial fluid pressure, and to enhance the transvascular transport through convection [24].
Protease- or hyaluronidase-mediated digestion of the ECM can enhance intratumoral penetration [25], and MMP-enhancing oncolytic relaxin is known to increase anti-tumor efficacy of virus spread [7]. Relaxin is a peptide hormone that is able to reduce the synthesis and secretion of interstitial collagens and increase the level of metalloproteinase (MMP) and oncolytic adenovirus expressing relaxin was shown to promote OV dispersal through the tumor ECM [7]. However, ECM degrading enzymes need to be used with caution since intracranical use of degrading enzymes can cause serious complications. For example, hemorrhagic necrosis of brain can be induced by collagenase-mediated ECM disruption, brain proteases are associated with neurodegenerative diseases [26], and hyaluronidase can promote optic glioma growth through astrocytic reactivity. [27].
Secreted and membrane-bound chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) linked to extracellular hyaluronan is one of major components of the ECM in the brain [13]. CSPGs include versican, brevican, phosphacan, and NG2. CSPGs also play a role as axon growth inhibitory molecules that are present in the glial scar, and are responsible in part for regeneration failure of scar after damage to the CNS [28]. In CNS tumors, increased expression of CSPGs is associated with tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis [29], and is responsible for diffusion-limiting properties [11]. Accumulated CSPGs in the glioma ECM increase tortuosity of the extracellular space and interstitial pressure within the tumor [11], leading to poor transport of large therapeutic agents [22]. Hence enzymatic manipulation, lowering the CSPG levels, would be a way of improving interstitial transport of therapeutic agents into the tumor. In this connection, ECM macromolecules have been considered as potential therapeutic targets for adjuvant therapy [30], [31]. For example, tumor proliferation and dispersion were inhibited when these molecules were reduced or inhibited by blocking antibodies against versican [30] or interfering RNA against phosphacan [32]. CSPGs can also be degraded by MMP-1 and MMP-8, leading an increase in hydraulic conductivity and particle diffusion in solid tumors [33].
Chondroitinase ABC I (Chase-ABC) is a bacterial enzyme that can remove Chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans from proteoglycans without any deleterious effects in vivo [11] and has been studied for its effect on neuronal regeneration after injury. Chase-ABC has been widely used to enhance regeneration of injured axonal tracts due to its a long-lasting 'loosening' effect on the ECM scaffold [28], [34]. Based on extensive positive evidence from preclinical models, Chase-ABC I have recently been used in Phase I/II trials for treatment of patients in Japan [35]. In an effort to investigate the use of bacterial chondroitinase to enhance anticancer therapy, Dmitrieva et al. [11] examined the effect of Chase-ABC on tumor ECM, OV spread, and efficacy. In the experiments, three-dimensional glioma spheroids placed on cultured brain slices were utilized to evaluate OV spread; see Figure 1A. Replication-conditional OV expressing Chase ABC (OV-Chase) was tested for spread and efficacy in glioma spheroids and glioma xenografts were utilized to compare anti-tumor efficacy of OV-Chase, HSVQ (control) and PBS. Dmitrieva et al. [11] found that OV spread in glioma spheroids grown on brain slices were significantly enhanced by Chase-ABC treatment, that cell migration or invasion were not enhanced by OV Chase treatment. Together these results suggest that degradation of ECM by OV expressed bacterial Chase-ABC was the key factor in enhancing OV spread and anti tumor efficacy. It has been shown that virus spreads more efficiently in spheroids compared to control-treated spheroids when they are treated with Chase [11]; see Figure 1B.

Overview of ECM degradation in experiments and schematic of the mathematical model.
(A) A schematic of ECM degradation and Chase ABC treated ECM. (B) In experiments [11], viral spread was evaluated 4 days after OV treatment through detection of the GFP-positive infected cells. Images in upper and lower panels show 3 representative spheroids (n = 6/group) treated with vehicle (Chase-) and Chase-ABC (Chase+), respectively (Figure 1D in [11]). Chase-treated viruses spread more efficiently throughout the spheroid compared to control-treated spheroids. Glioma U87EGFR spheroids were cultured on organotypic brain slices for 72 hours followed by treatment with purified Chase-ABC or vehicle for 24 hours before or after infection with rQNestin34.5.

Kim et al. [36] recently developed a mathematical model of invasive glioma cells in 3D tumor spheroids. The model was shown to be capable of reproducing migration patterns of glioma cells in in vitro experiments, exhibiting, in particular, dispersion and branching of cells. The model included MMP activity and glucose levels as well as chemotaxis, haptotaxis and cell-cell adhesion forces. The rapid migration of cells is caused primarily by the chemotaxis forces including glucose levels. There are several mathematical models of brain tumors based on reaction-diffusion process [37]–[41], cellular automata [42], the transition between migration and proliferation using kinetic or diffusion models [43]–[45], and intracellular signaling pathways [1], [46], [47]. A general review on mathematical models of tumor growth can be found in [48], [49].
In this paper we develop a mathematical model based on the schematic diagram of Figure 1C. The model consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations involving the following variables:
It will be shown that the model simulations for a spherical glioma are in qualitative agreement with experimental results of [11]. It is a common practice to inject the virus into serval different locations within the tumor. The mathematical model can be used to determine preferred locations for such injections. In Materials and Methods section, we present the mathematical model, and in Results Section we simulate the model, and then also perform several experiments and propose some hypotheses. Parameter estimation, nondimensionalization of the model and numerical scheme of dimensionless governing equations are given in Text S1.
