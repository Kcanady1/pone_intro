Introduction
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is an exceptionally powerful technique at the core of modern nanoscience. Indeed, many would argue that the origins of the entire field of nanoscale science lie in the invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) in the early eighties [1]. Single atoms and molecules are now not only routinely resolved with STM but, under appropriate experimental conditions, can be precisely positioned [2]–[5] to form artificial nanostructures exhibiting fascinating quantum mechanical properties [6]–[8].
The development of the atomic force microscope (AFM) [9] shortly after the introduction of the STM broadened the applicability of SPM to a much wider variety of substrates — including insulators in particular — and led to the adoption of SPM as a high resolution imaging technique in very many scientific disciplines and sub-fields. The state of the art in atomic force microscopy is no longer ‘just’ atomic resolution [10] (a remarkable achievement in itself), but the imaging of intramolecular bonds [11]–[13] and intermolecular structure (whose origin is currently an active area of debate [14], [15]). Furthermore, SPM systems now operate in a range of environments spanning what might be termed ‘extreme’ conditions — ultrahigh vacuum, low temperatures, and high magnetic fields (for example, an STM running at 10 milliKelvin in a field of 15 T has recently been developed [16]) — to the in vitro application of AFM to study biochemical and biomedical processes [17]. A significant number of commercial suppliers also now provide ‘turn-key’ SPM systems such that the probe microscope has evolved into a standard characterisation tool in the vast majority of nanoscience laboratories.
Unfortunately, however, with the exceptional capabilities of the scanning probe microscope come a plethora of frustrating instrumental artefacts. These can give rise to images which, although initially appearing entirely plausible, unsettlingly arise from a variety of sources including improper settings of the microscope parameters (for example, the feedback loop gains used to control the motion of the scanning probe), external electrical or vibrational noise, and/or convolution of the sample topography with the structure of the probe. The latter is especially problematic when the features of interest at the sample surface have a radius of curvature which is comparable to that of the tip.
While some of these SPM artefacts, such as those due to improper feedback loop settings, are relatively straight-forward to diagnose and eliminate, tip-sample convolution can often require particularly careful and systematic experimental technique to identify and remove [18]. Debates in the literature regarding artefacts in atomic/molecular resolution images arising from, e.g., ‘double’ or multiple tips [19], and/or tip asymmetry [20], show that, unless appropriate experimental protocols have been used to ensure that the SPM images are as free of tip influence as possible, it can be exceptionally difficult to deconvolve the influence of the tip structure from the final image. In addition, without appropriate control samples it is entirely possible to misinterpret genuine and mundane surface features as new and hitherto unobserved aspects of the molecule or structure of interest. This latter problem was brought sharply to the fore in the early days of STM when the results of very high profile papers claiming to have attained high resolution images of DNA and other biomolecules on graphite were replicated on freshly cleaved, i.e. entirely molecule-free, substrates. The ‘molecular’ images were shown in a number of cases to arise from step edges and graphitic fragments (“flakes”) on the bare graphite surface [21].
In this paper we critique, in the context of the SPM artefacts described above, the body of highly-cited work published by Stellacci and co-workers over the last decade or so (see, for example, [22]–[26]), which claims that stripes form in the ligand shell of appropriately functionalised gold nanoparticles. These claims have subsequently led to the proposal that ligand stripes substantially influence the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate cell membranes [25], and, very recently, Cho et al. [26] have argued that the striped morphology enables high selectivity for heavy metal cations (although there are unresolved issues regarding the lack of appropriate control samples for this study [27]). By combining an extensive re-analysis of Stellacci et al.'s data with imaging of a simple control sample comprising ligand-free nanoparticles, we show that the scanning probe data published to date provide no evidence for stripe formation and instead can be explained by a combination of instrumental artefacts, data selection, and observer bias (See disclaimer at end of text). For completeness, we also consider the evidence, or lack thereof, for stripe formation from other techniques such as transmission electron microscopy [23], nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [28], small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [29], and computer simulations [30]. Taken together, our analyses provide important insights into the pitfalls of not adopting an extremely critical, systematic, and sceptical approach to SPM imaging of nanostructured samples.
