Introduction
The World Health Organization has identified tobacco smoking and binge alcohol drinking as two of the leading risk factors for premature mortality worldwide [1], [2]. In India, 14% per cent of the population above age 15 smoke tobacco (24% for men and 3% for women) [3]. Smoking is already responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths for men and 1 in 20 deaths for women at ages 30–69 [4]. India has among the lowest alcohol use per capita in the world, but reports growth in alcohol sales [5], [6]. More importantly, male alcohol drinking in India is characterized by problematic drinking (e.g. binge-drinking), which has negative health and social impacts on the consumers and their families [5], [7].
Most studies examined tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking behaviours separately among the Indian population. Few studies which examined the concurrent use of tobacco and alcohol found that smokers have a higher likelihood to drink alcohol than non-smokers [8], and vice versa [9], [10].
Understanding the geographic distributions of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking, along with the determinants contributing to their use, is essential for developing targeted tobacco and alcohol control policies. Previous studies have examined the distributions of tobacco smoking [11]–[13] and alcohol drinking [14] in India at the state level separately. State level analysis can potentially mask the sub-state spatial heterogeneity, especially in the bigger states (e.g. 17 Indian states have populations greater than 25 million [15]). Implementation of tobacco and alcohol control policies is the responsibility of the state government [6], [16], thus studying the distributions of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking as well as their spatial association at the sub-state level is desirable.
Advances in geographic information system (GIS) technology enable analysis of public health phenomena by taking “space” into account [17]. GIS is an integrated set of tools that allow both the analytical manipulation and the visual presentation of spatial data [17], [18]. Epidemiologic studies have employed GIS methods for disease mapping and cluster detection [19]–[21], and although these types of research often focus on diseases, GIS methods can also study risk factors for diseases.
Here, we utilized GIS methods to analyze the distributions of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking in India. Our objective was to identify sub-state regions with significantly high and low prevalence of smoking and drinking. We also explored whether smoking and drinking were spatially correlated.
