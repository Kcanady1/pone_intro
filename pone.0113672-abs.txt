Introduction
In previous work, the rate of spread of the Neolithic transition in Europe has been accurately quantified by means of linear regressions, which yield a speed of about 1 km/yr [1], [2]. The same approach has been applied to the initial peopling of America [3]. But the spread rate of the Neolithic transition in continents other than Europe has not been accurately quantified by means of sound statistical techniques (e.g., linear regressions over large distances). For this reason, at present there are two open possibilities. Perhaps a value of about 1 km/yr is characteristic only of Europe. Alternatively, if such a spread rate were observed in several continents, it could reflect an intrinsic feature of the shift from a hunting and gathering way of life into farming/herding, i.e. a universal law for Neolithic transitions all over the world. In order to answer this question, it is necessary to quantify spread rates of the Neolithic transition in continents other than Europe through the analysis of numerous, high-quality data.
There are two main models of Neolithic transitions. According to the demic model [4], the spread of Neolithic economies is due to a range expansion of Neolithic populations (i.e., farmers/herders). According to the cultural model [5], it is due to the conversion of hunter-gatherers into farmers/herders. However, some authors have argued for the importance of both demic and cultural diffusion [6], [7].
In the European case, the observed value of about 1 km/yr [1], [2], [7] is due to the spread being driven mainly by demic diffusion (i.e., with cultural diffusion playing a secondary role) according to a recent wave-of-advance model that unifies demic and cultural diffusion [8]. Also according to that model, if additional Neolithic spread rates of about 1 km/yr were observed (in other continents), they would also indicate mainly demic diffusion transitions. In contrast, if a Neolithic spread rate were substantially faster than 1 km/yr, cultural diffusion would have a more important effect than demic diffusion [8] (see Figs. 1 and 2 therein). However, Neolithic spread rates substantially faster than 1 km/yr have not yet been observed. Here we report such a fast Neolithic spread rate, and analyze its implications on the importance of demic and cultural diffusion.

A related open problem is that, in some cases, the Neolithic transition was not a shift from hunter-gathering into farming (with stockbreeding) but into herding or fully developed pastoralism. Pastoralism is understood here as “…a way of life that was economically, socially and symbolically focused on livestock management” [9], while herding is regarded as smaller in scale and with economic flexibility that allows complementary subsistence activities such as hunting, gathering and fishing [10], [11]. Late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries historical records from the Cape of Good Hope (present day South Africa) describe pastoralists (the ‘Khoikhoi’) who reared domestic cattle and sheep in large numbers and also possessed goats and dogs and made ceramics. These groups neither grew crops nor did they have an iron-working technology (in contrast with the Bantu Iron Age farmers who moved and settled into the eastern half of southern Africa about 2000 years ago). Non-agricultural herding spread to central, western and southern parts of southern Africa as explained below [9], [12]. There is a consensus that Khoikhoi domesticates must have been introduced from north of the Equator as they do not have wild progenitors in southern Africa [13]–[14]. More debate surrounds the origins, timing, hypothetical routes by which domesticates would have spread southwards [13], [15]–[17], and the mechanisms involved in their introduction to southern Africa [9], [10], [14], [18]–[22].
Purely demic diffusion models of the spread of herding across southern Africa assume that groups of immigrant people moved through various landscapes bringing first sheep and then cattle. Such models assume that the conversion of hunter-gatherers into herders did not have an important effect in this process, so we refer to them as purely demic models. Within purely demic models, different authors have proposed different routes for the introduction of stock [15]–[17], [23], but in the present paper we will not tackle the problem of which route was more likely. Instead, our purpose here is to contribute to the debate between demic and cultural models.
Proponents of cultural diffusion argue that stock and herding skills were initially introduced by pastoralists to neighboring hunter-gatherers who then passed on the knowledge of herding and live animals to other nearby hunter-gatherer groups through exchange networks [9], [10], [14], [18], [19], [24]. Mid- to late-twentieth-century Kalahari hunter-gatherers who kept small flocks of goats while continuing to rely on wild food [25]–[27] are often presented as analogues for past small-scale herder-forager groups responsible for the introduction of stock into southernmost Africa. The possibility of several potential episodes of small-scale demic migrations and hybridization, however, is recognized by some of those who defend a cultural diffusion model [9], [24].
Much of the evidence brought to bear in these models range from studies on linguistics, oral traditions, diversity of ceramic styles, types of rock art imagery, and on absolute dates for the earliest livestock bones and ceramics, quantified observations on other material culture recovered from archaeological excavations, and lately also genetic data [9], [20], [21], [28]–[33]. However, with the exception of the work by Russell [21] on the spread of a specific domesticate (the African fat-tailed sheep), which is discussed in the Results section below, no other study supported by mathematical modelling of spatially mapped data has been undertaken until now.
Since 2004, a number of sites with reliably dated early domestic fauna have been excavated and published (Table 1). Here we analyze these data to estimate the spread rate of this process, as necessary to calculate the relative contributions of demic and cultural diffusion in the framework of a recent wave-of-advance model [8].
