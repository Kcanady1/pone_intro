Introduction
Previous studies document a general decline in snowpack over the last half century throughout the western United States [1], [2]. The loss of snowpack coincides with regional warming, and within California the warming trend is expected to continue with expected increases in mean annual temperatures of 2.2 to 8.3°C over the next 100 years [3]. Documented effects of regional warming in California’s alpine regions include: earlier onset of spring snowmelt [4]–[6], reduced summer base flows [7], [8], declines in snowpack volumes at mid-elevations [9], and migration of the rain to snow transition line to higher elevations [10].
In the midst of regional declines in snowpack previous studies documented a net increase in snowpack at elevations above 2,500 m within the southern Sierra Nevada [1], [11], [12]. This reversal from the regional decline in snowpack may be related to increases in atmospheric moisture due to the presence of warmer air masses capable of holding more water [2]. Increases in atmospheric moisture combined with adiabatic cooling can lead to increased snow accumulation at the highest elevations where winter and early spring temperatures remain below the temperature threshold for the transition from snow to rain, even under predicted regional warming.
Due to its complex glaciated terrain the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion (Figure 1) is prone to cold-air pooling (CAP), a nocturnal atmospheric process that sustains cooler air temperatures in CAP–prone areas. On calm clear nights air in contact with the ground cools due to radiative energy loss. Being denser than the free atmosphere at the same elevation, this colder-denser air becomes decoupled and sinks into topographic depressions. CAP occurs where cooled air collects on the landscape. CAP generally occurs in concavities and areas cut off from the free atmosphere, typically along flat valley bottoms in mountainous terrain with valley constrictions [13]–[21]. Exposed ridges and topographic convexities are not prone to CAP.

Due to the decoupling and sinking of colder denser air, CAP-prone areas may respond differently to predicted climate change than surrounding terrain. For example, CAP-prone snow covered sites in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, warm less rapidly than non-CAP sites located in exposed locations [22]. Furthermore, CAP may not only diminish the impacts of regional warming in high mountain valleys [23], [24] but, along with coincident topographic shading provided by surrounding terrain, CAP may actually delay snowmelt despite increases in air temperatures [6]. In this study we investigate the influence of CAP on air temperatures and snowmelt and assess whether incorporating CAP into future climate scenarios leads to snowpack persistence.
The trajectory of change in snowpack under future climates will undoubtedly impact snow-dependent ecology. Consequently, habitat-scale projections of future snowpack conditions are needed to provide information to support conservation and management decisions. In this study we use the wolverine (Gulo gulo) as an example species. Because the wolverine is an obligate carnivore with a northern circumpolar distribution [25] it’s range limits are strongly correlated with snow covered areas [26], [27]. Current research indicates that spring snowpack is a critical resource for providing suitable denning sites to support successful wolverine reproduction [28].
Historically, the Sierra Nevada wolverine population represented the southernmost extent of the species’ range, but wolverines were believed to be extirpated from this region by the 1920s [26], [29]–[32]. In 2008, a lone male wolverine (Figure 1), most likely an immigrant from Idaho, was photo-documented [33]. If a population of wolverines is re-established in the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion, it would provide population redundancy to this threatened species, which currently only occupies a small area of the northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains in the conterminous United States [26], [34]. Determining the feasibility of wolverine reintroduction to the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion requires investigation of potential suitable habitat that includes adequate spring snowpack under current and future climates.
We present a unique approach for developing spatially distributed estimates of snowpack under future climates. Currently, global climate models (GCMs) are developed at coarse spatial scales and future climate projections cannot represent fine-scale processes. It is well recognized that fine-scale modeling incorporates the effects of topographic heterogeneity and results in improved precipitation estimates [35], [36]. A fine-scale is further required to capture processes that control accumulation, melt, and sublimation of snow [37]. However, this is the first study that incorporates a fine-scale process such as CAP into projections of snowpack under future climates. Our methodology includes the definition and application of a temperature correction factor such that the role of CAP, in mitigating snowmelt and sustaining the depth and extent of snow covered areas, is incorporated into future projections of snowpack. We then present an example ecological application by investigating late spring snowpack conditions under historic, current and future climates and the presence of snow covered habitat in four National Park units with proposed wolverine reintroduction programs.

Study Area
The study area encompasses 131,650 km2 of the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion (Figure 1). We further highlight results for four National Park units with proposed wolverine reintroduction programs. The park units include Yosemite (YOSE), Sequoia-Kings Canyon (SEKI), and Devils Postpile (DEPO) within the Sierra Nevada National Park Network and Lassen (LAVO) National Park from the Klamath Network. Elevations within the study area range from 40 to 4,415 m, with the highest elevations occurring in the southern Sierra Nevada. Under the current climate, mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 cm on the western edge of the study area to more than 150 cm at the highest elevations along the Sierra Nevada crest [38]. Precipitation is generated primarily by Pacific frontal systems that supply approximately 85% of annual precipitation between November and April.
Regions above 3,000 m were glaciated repeatedly throughout the Quaternary geologic period [39], [40]. Topographic shading and CAP allowed small glaciers in sheltered high mountain cirques to persist at elevations well below the regional permanent snowline defined at 4,500 m [41]. The persistence of permanent snowpack throughout the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion over geologic time scales and at relatively lower elevations highlights a distinct ability for producing and sustaining snowpack and snow covered habitat.
The glaciated terrain of the Sierra Nevada is uniquely suited for producing CAP due to characteristic valley morphologies. Fluvial and glacial valley profiles are typically concave, but glacial valley profiles are over-deepened with higher concavities and steeper headwater profiles [42], [43] and typically have wide flat valley bottoms and lower gradients at the glacial terminus [44], [45]. CAP is further influenced by valley constrictions that occur where wider U-shaped glacial valleys transition into narrower V-shaped fluvial valleys. Hanging valleys, located at the confluence of tributary and trunk streams, and stepped topography, formed due to an increase in cross sectional area to accommodate the added tributary stream discharge, are additional topographic complexities [41] that may increase the potential for CAP in glaciated terrain.
