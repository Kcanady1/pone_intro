Introduction
Avian diversity has been under increasing pressure from anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss and fragmentation [1]. Successful conservation planning relies upon understanding how the distribution of avian richness responds to existing and potential changes in environmental conditions which influence their distributions. Discovering the drivers of large-scale spatial variation of species richness has been a central debate in ecology [2]–[5], and many hypotheses have been proposed to address this issue [6]–[11]. One major hypothesis suggests that habitat heterogeneity is a key factor because it leads to greater spatial variability of habitat physical conditions, and therefore permits greater niche specialization resulting in more species richness [12]–[15]. Particularly in North America, habitat heterogeneity theory predicted the richness of some faunas significantly better than the species-energy theory [7], [14], [15]. This latter theory also has widespread support, and hypothesizes that productive energy through food webs or species physiological constraints to ambient energy determines species richness [4], [6], [8], [16].
Traditionally large scale habitat heterogeneity has been quantified mostly as topographical variability [7], [14], [17] or two dimensional habitat characteristics derived from remote sensing products [18], [19]. Vertical habitat structure may also lead to niche generalization, and as such be an important element of habitat heterogeneity affecting biodiversity [20]. However, it has rarely been used to explain species richness at broad scales. The incorporation of vertical heterogeneity is especially important for avian richness models where vertical habitat structure at local scales has long been recognized as a critical factor influencing bird life history [21]–[23] and abundance [24], [25].
Until recently, there have been relatively few studies utilizing three-dimensional habitat information due to difficulties of acquiring measurements of vertical vegetation structure beyond the plot scale over extended geographical areas [20]. This has changed significantly since the emergence of active remote sensing systems such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) and Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) which provide capability to map the vertical dimension of vegetation at local to regional scales [20], [26]. There is an increasing number of studies using lidar and radar derived three-dimensional vegetation structure to model biodiversity, many of which have revealed significant association between vegetation vertical structure, habitat quality, species richness and abundance [27]–[32]. However, none of the existing habitat metrics sufficiently characterize the spatial arrangement of vegetation height (i.e. the heterogeneity of height), nor its potential for predicting avian richness distributions over large geographical extents.
Related advances have been made in the development of statistical fusion models that provide a means to effectively combine remotely sensed data from radar, lidar, optical remote sensing systems and forest inventory data, yielding wall-to-wall high resolution vegetation structure maps at the continental scale [33]–[37]. The production of these maps not only enables the creation of habitat metrics that capture rich vegetation height heterogeneity, but also the comparison of the predictive abilities in various forms of these metrics. Our study is designed to embrace these opportunities by examining the relationship between forest bird richness, height-structured habitat metrics and avian richness models involving various degrees of forest height heterogeneity.
The overall goal of our study is to examine the potential of three-dimensional habitat structure in improving avian richness models at broad geographical scales. In doing so we hope to expand our understanding of the relationship between habitat structure and the spatial distribution of avian species richness, and to lay the foundation for constructing habitat metrics that better utilize increasingly available three-dimensional habitat data. Specifically we address the following questions:

How do the height-structured metrics compare with traditional habitat metrics in their ability to associate and predict forest bird richness in the forested ecoregion of the U.S.? Does incorporating the height-structured metrics improve the explanatory ability of avian richness models that use traditional habitat metrics?

How do the predictive abilities of richness models vary among forest bird guilds with contrasting preferences to habitat edges?

First, we introduce the conceptual similarities and differences between traditional habitat metrics and two types of height-structured metrics. Next, we describe the data and the methods we used to create the habitat metrics in this study. We then use correlation analysis and multivariate regression models to examine the relationships between different combinations of metrics and the species richness of three forest breeding bird guilds. Lastly, we examine the models’ explanatory abilities and the importance of individual metrics in predicting the richness of the three guilds.
