Introduction
Genetic diversity is an important aspect of the dynamics of populations, as it is directly related to the evolutionary potential of the population and the deleterious effects of inbreeding [1]. There are, however, several different types of measures of genetic diversity, most notably measures based on heterozygosity and measures based on allelic richness (defined as the number of alleles). These groups of measures differ in their formulations, their ecological and evolutionary interpretations, and the mathematical frameworks in which they can be applied [2]–[4].
Observed heterozygosity (HO), the frequency of heterozygous individuals in a population, or expected heterozygosity (HE), the probability that two gametes, randomly chosen from the gene pool, are of different alleles, are by far the measures most commonly used by the majority of papers that present a genetic summary of populations [4] (e.g., [5], [6]). These measures are very sensitive to the allele frequencies in the population, rather than just to the number of alleles. It has been shown that a decrease in the observed heterozygosity can induce a decrease in the average fitness of individuals [7], [8], and thus this measure has clear ecological consequences. There exists an extensive mathematical framework, F-statistics, first presented by Wright [9], that allows for the modeling and analysis of varied scenarios regarding heterozygosity, as well as the inclusion of processes such as gene flow to provide quantitative predictions and assessments. Allele richness (also referred to as allelic diversity) is calculated as the average number of alleles per locus [1]. A decrease in the allelic richness could lead to a reduction in the population's potential to adapt to future environmental changes, since this diversity is the raw material for evolution by natural selection [10]. While not all variation is related to the adaptive potential, clearly no standing variation exists if no allelic richness exists. Moreover, there is evidence that high allelic richness, even of merely neutral alleles, increases evolvability by making a larger fraction of the genotypic space accessible by fewer mutational events [11]. Allelic richness is, therefore, a strong indicator for the evolutionary potential of a population [2], [3], [12], and it has been suggested that this measure is of key importance in population conservation and management [13]–[18]. Allelic richness measures are also commonly presented in population genetic summaries (as the number of alleles in a given locus or the mean number of alleles per locus). However, in practice, conclusions pertaining to these measures are often merely comparative, such as “population A has higher allelic richness than population B” or “the population had higher allelic richness at time T than at time S”, and not quantitative.
As human activity pushes many species closer to extinction, conservation of populations is increasingly becoming a major concern, and an important aspect of conservation is addressing the preservation of genetic diversity [19]. Conservation programs combine general rules and guidelines, usually derived from the F-Statistics framework, with the specific ecological scenario in question [12], [20]. One such general rule, concerning gene flow, is the “One Migrant per Generation” (OMPG) rule [12], [21]. The rule states that, under the conditions of an island model of migration in which gene flow is not influenced by distance or any geographical feature, an exchange of one effective migrant per generation (effective migrants are migrants that breed and contribute to the population's gene pool; for the purpose of this paper, all migrants will be regarded as effective migrants) is enough to adequately maintain the genetic diversity of the population [22], [23]. This rule is derived from the island model [24], and other F-statistics models have been formulated (e.g., the stepping stone model [25]), but they are used less frequently as conservation guidelines.
Founder events are known to decrease the genetic diversity of the population [26], and are often followed by a demographic expansion. It has been shown, both theoretically [2], [26]–[30] and empirically [27], [31], that allelic richness is more sensitive than heterozygosity to founder events followed by expansions, since allelic richness does not consider abundances of the alleles but only their presence (a rare allele that is lost in a founder event will probably not affect heterozygosity much, but the loss does reduce allelic richness). Moreover, allelic richness is more indicative of the evolutionary potential of the population in the long-run in these scenarios [2], [3], [12], as the existence of alleles, rather than their frequencies, holds a significant part of potential for response to selection, as selection limits are determined by the initial allelic composition [13], [32] (studied for biallelic loci by [33]–[35]) rather than by levels of heterozygosity. For example, consider a population with n different alleles with different selection coefficients (e.g., taken randomly from a uniform distribution U(0,1)). If we consider that only selection is at play, eventually alleles with the highest selection coefficients will become abundant while the rest will be lost. Thus the eventual fitness of the population will be determined by the expected maximal value of the initial selection coefficients, a value which depends on n, the number of alleles ( in the case of the uniform distribution above). This maximal value is higher when n is larger, and therefore, populations with higher allelic richness are expected to eventually show higher average fitness, under these assumptions. Nevertheless, most theoretical models and conservation applications pertaining to these scenarios are still drawn from the F-Statistics framework [4], where higher heterozygosity levels are considered to convey increased response to selection. While some work has been done in modeling allelic richness [36]–[39], the field has not yet been fully investigated.
Founder events are often followed by a loss of alleles, referred to as the “founder effect” [40]. The founders of the new population seldom carry all the alleles that existed in the original population. This loss of alleles might later be countered by gene flow induced by migrants arriving from the source population carrying the lost alleles, and therefore, gene flow is a force that may recover allelic richness, as well as heterozygosity [41]. Since founded populations are usually small, genetic drift – the stochastic element of the genetic process that can lead to the loss of alleles – is another relevant genetic force that needs to be taken into account. These two forces can be seen as acting in opposing directions in the founded population, with gene flow potentially generating an increase in allelic richness and genetic drift leading to a decrease.
The goal of this paper is to present a simulation framework, to be used as a method for estimating the maintenance and recovery of allelic richness, as well as for identifying the appropriate statistical properties with which to address allelic richness in similar modeling frameworks. A model was developed in a neutral theory [42], [43] context that focuses on gene flow and genetic drift in a founder scenario. The model tracks and simulates a single allele lost in the founder event under different demographic parameters and allele frequencies, and later it is shown how the single-allele results can be extended and applied to the entire allele frequency spectrum to give a meaningful estimation of overall allelic richness recovery. While the model does not include mutation and selection, although they may be relevant in many scenarios, it provides insights into the potential effect of gene flow in the recovery of allelic richness. The model's results also demonstrate that the OMPG rule may not be sufficient to conserve allelic richness, and thus they emphasize the need to distinguish between allelic richness and heterozygosity regarding management conclusions pertaining to migration rates between populations. Such conclusions should be drawn while taking both measures into account.
