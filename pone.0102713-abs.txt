Introduction
In The Origin of Species [1], Darwin used examples of artificial selection to lay the groundwork for his natural selection analog. More recently, experiments using artificial selection have greatly increased our understanding of both short- and long-term evolutionary processes [2]. Indeed, while the role of group selection in natural settings is a controversial topic [3], [ 4], artificial group selection experiments have demonstrated that selection at the level of the group can produce targeted evolutionary responses [2], [ 5]–[8]. For example, in a classic group selection experiment, Wade preferentially selected groups of flour beetles (Tribolium castancum) for both large and small group sizes [7]. After nine group-selection events, the beetles selected for large group size averaged 178 individuals, while the beetles selected for small group size averaged only 20 individuals. More recently, Swenson et al. have shown that artificial group selection can produce soil systems supporting an increased plant biomass [5], and aquatic ecosystems with a specific pH [6].
Of particular interest are instances of antagonistic multilevel selection, where the between-group pressure (i.e., whether groups thrive) conflicts with the within-group pressure (i.e., whether individuals within the group thrive). For example, within Wade's study, there are indications that selecting groups for larger population sizes involved antagonistic multilevel selection pressures. Cannibalism would provide an individual with a within-group advantage, but groups of cannibals would likely have a smaller population size and thus a between-group disadvantage. Specifically, when groups with larger population sizes were preferentially propagated, cannibalism was a group-level liability. Indeed, individuals exhibited lower rates of cannibalism when large groups were selected for [8]. Conversely, cannibalism rates were higher when groups with smaller populations were preferentially propagated.
Antagonistic multilevel pressures are frequently observed in groups that exhibit division of labor within nature, where there is a within-group pressure to specialize on the role with the highest reward and a between-group pressure to perform a diverse suite of tasks. These groups, which vary in scale and complexity, include a host cell and its mitochondria [9], the cells of a multicellular organism [9], [ 10], insects within colonies of eusocial arthropods [11]–[15], and even humans within societies [16], [ 17]. Even though these groups are the epitome of high-level functionality, when the within-group pressure asserts itself, it can produce ills such as mitochondrial and nuclear genome interactions that result in plants that do not produce viable pollen [18], cancer within multicellular organisms [19], defector insects within eusocial colonies [20], and criminals within human societies [21]. While we present our work in terms of multilevel selection [22], [ 23], such evolution can also be viewed from an inclusive fitness perspective [24]–[26] (where a focal individual's fitness can be decomposed into the effects of its phenotype on individuals within its group, including itself, weighted by its relatedness to these individuals). Ideally, a complete analysis of antagonistic multilevel selection pressures would include open-ended evolutionary dynamics in a system that has rapid generation times and is tractable enough to facilitate an exploration of mechanisms.
For this study, we use the Avida digital evolution platform [27]. Digital evolution is a form of experimental evolution, where organisms are self-replicating computer programs that evolve in a user-defined computational environment and are subject to mutations and natural selection. These digital organisms execute instructions in their genome to metabolize resources in the environment, interact with neighboring organisms, and self-replicate. Digital evolution has previously been used to study topics in evolutionary biology ranging from the origin of complex features [28], modularity [29], leader election [30], [ 31], altruism [32]–[35], and division of labor [36]–[38]. Digital evolution fills a unique niche in the study of evolutionary phenomena. In contrast to analytical models and simulations, the digital approach is an open-ended instance of evolution. However, in contrast to experimental evolution with organic systems, digital evolution enables us to study evolution over many more generations, and with unparalleled experimental control and automated data collection, which facilitates the exploration of mechanisms employed by digital organisms. For this study, digital evolution enables us to manipulate factors that may affect the course of evolution within a group-structured system. Specifically, we vary the degree of antagonism among group and individual selection pressures, the methods by which groups are formed, and how group members interact.
We first examine the evolutionary trajectories of groups that exhibit division of labor when individual roles have different fitness benefits. We begin these experiments with several isolated groups of genetically-identical ancestor organisms, and allow these organisms to differentiate via mutation. In this paper, we address the question: Given both a between-group pressure to perform a variety of tasks, and a within-group pressure to perform the task with the highest associated fitness benefit, under which conditions will groups of organisms evolve to perform a diverse suite of tasks? Second, when division of labor evolves, we explore how individuals fill different roles, especially roles that have a within -group disadvantage. Within nature, we observe two common strategies: (1) Organisms may form single-lineage groups (i.e., groups of closely-related individuals), where some members perform less rewarded roles via phenotypic plasticity (e.g., workers in eusocial colonies and somatic cells within multicellular organisms); or (2), organisms may coexist within genetically heterogeneous groups (e.g., a host cell and its mitochondria), where different genetic lineages occupy distinct niches and are co-transmitted to the next generation. Digital evolution enables us to examine the conditions under which single-lineage or multi-lineage groups of organisms are favored by selection. We then explore the mechanisms by which individuals within single-lineage and multi-lineage groups coordinate to perform different roles.
