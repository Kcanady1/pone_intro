Introduction
Government agencies are increasingly interested in using social media to distribute information at the national, state and local levels. U.S federal agencies, for example, routinely use a variety of social media sites including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, and Instagram to enhance communication [1]. In addition to distributing information, government agencies are increasingly interested in interacting with the populations they serve. For example, new guidelines entitled “Digital Governmental Strategy” outline specific steps for governmental agencies to make digital information more “customer centric” [2]. This bidirectional form of communication can be defined as engagement: interactions designed to promote some common goal [3].
To date no study has systematically explored factors associated with the levels of health agency engagement on social media. Our objective is to address this gap by using retweeting as a measure of engagement. Specifically we address the following three questions with respect to Twitter messages posted by US Federal Health agencies and their responses. First, which features are associated with the level of response in the form of retweets? Second, which features are associated with the interval between an agency's tweet and its first retweet? Third, which features are associated with the interval between an agency's tweet and the last retweet it generates? We address our goals by analyzing an almost comprehensive set of tweets posted by the 130 Twitter accounts of 25 Federal Health Agencies. We explore associations between factors with level of retweeting using hurdle models. We explore the temporal factors related to our second and third questions using survival models. Factors we examine include standard features such as the number of friends and followers as well as less studied features relating to the semantic content of a tweet.
