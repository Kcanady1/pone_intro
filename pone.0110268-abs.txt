Introduction
Archiving and sharing published data is a social contract that is integral to the scientific enterprise [1]. Sharing published data advances the scientific process by: (1) exposing published results to independent verification (to identify errors and discourage fraud); (2) providing the pedagogical material for educating students and training future researchers; (3) acting as a test bed to guide the development of new methods, and; (4) providing a basis to identify and pursue new questions via synthesis/meta-analysis [2]. Additionally, archiving published data protects our scientific investment, avoiding needless costs of data regeneration in terms of time, money, and environmental impact [3].
These considerations are particularly germane to phylogenetic data, which include both alignments (estimates of the positional homology of molecular sequences) and phylogenetic trees (estimates of the evolutionary relationships among species). Phylogenetic trees for individual groups are inherently synthetic—combination of these ‘twigs’ provides a natural approach for elucidating the entire Tree of Life, c.f., [4], [5]. Additionally, phylogenetic data have tremendous potential for reuse, often in ways that were completely unanticipated by the original studies: because they provide an explicit evolutionary perspective, phylogenies have become central to virtually all areas of research in evolutionary biology, ecology, molecular biology and epidemiology [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, the generation of phylogenetic data is an increasingly arduous and technical enterprise. Clearly, phylogenetic data are a precious scientific resource that must be preserved and shared in order to realize their full potential.
The vast majority of phylogenies are estimated from molecular (primarily nucleotide) sequence data. Although GenBank and similar public archives provide a robust (albeit imperfect, [9]) backstop against the complete loss of the raw sequence data, these databases do not safeguard the associated phylogenetic data: the alignments estimated from raw sequence data, and the trees inferred from those alignments. Multiple sequence alignment—the process of estimating the positional homology of each nucleotide site comprising DNA sequences—is a difficult inference problem for which many approaches have been proposed [10], [11]. Different algorithms (or different settings for a given algorithm) may yield dramatically different estimates of the alignment that, in turn, can substantially impact estimates of phylogeny [12], [13]. Moreover, the majority of phylogenetic studies are based on alignments that are subjected to ‘manual adjustment’ after being estimated using formal methods [14], which effectively destroys the possibility of replicating published alignments from the corresponding raw sequence data. Even if the alignment could be dependably reproduced, replicating the published phylogeny requires a precise description of how the phylogenetic analysis was performed, details that are typically not provided in phylogenetic studies [15]. Finally, even if the alignment and details of the analysis were available, re-generating the phylogeny remains a non-trivial proposition: the analysis of a single dataset may require hundreds or thousands of compute hours [16].
These issues have been appreciated for some time [17], and motivated the development of a specialized online archive for phylogenetic data, TreeBASE [18], more than 20 years ago. Despite such noble efforts, it is increasingly evident that the loss of phylogenetic data is catastrophic: recent surveys estimate that  of published phylogenetic data are lost forever [8], [19], [20]. In response to this crisis, several recent community initiatives have been proposed to encourage the preservation and sharing of phylogenetic data. These include policy initiatives both by funding agencies (the NSF Data Management Plan established in 2011 that requires the preservation of data generated by funded research), and by journals/publishers (the establishment of the Joint Data Archiving Policy, JDAP, by a consortium of prominent journals requiring the submission of data to online archives as a condition of publication [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]), and the establishment of a new online archive for evolutionary and ecological data, Dryad [26].
We set out to perform a meta-analysis exploring the empirical prevalence of temporal changes in rates of lineage diversification. To this end, we sought to collect the phylogenetic data from studies using the two most common statistical phylogenetic approaches for detecting temporal shifts in diversification rate; i.e., the ‘gamma’ statistic (‘method 1’ [27]) and the ‘birth-death likelihood’ (‘method 2’ [28]) methods. To be included in our meta-analysis, we required two key data files from each published empirical study: (1) an alignment of nucleotide sequence data, and (2) an ultrametric tree (where the branch lengths are rendered proportional to relative or absolute time). We document our attempts to procure these data (both via searches of online archives and by direct solicitation from the corresponding authors), and describe results of analyses exploring various factors associated with the availability of phylogenetic data. We assess a number of correlates—the age of the study, the impact factor and data-sharing policy of the publishing journal, the status of the solicitor, etc.—with a focus on revealing the efficacy of recent community initiatives to ensure the preservation and promote the sharing of published phylogenetic data.
