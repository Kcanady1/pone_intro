Introduction
Wildlife conservation within protected areas in the tropics is commonly challenged by two interacting factors: 1) protected areas are under pressure of large-scale resource extraction and associated road development, and 2) protected areas are often occupied by people who depend on wildlife for their survival [1], [2], [3]. In the Amazon Basin, protected areas and indigenous territories total 3,502,750 km2 representing 45% of the Basin [4]. This vast extension of protected forest could indicate a high probability of success for future conservation of wildlife populations in the region [5], [6], [7]. However, these lands are threatened by large-scale development, including road building to access valuable resources such as soils for agriculture, timber, hydropower, oil, gas and minerals [8], [9], [10], [11]. As national economies strongly depend on natural resources to develop, substantial increases in road networks within or adjacent to natural areas are predicted across the region and other tropical areas [10], [12], [13]. For example, plans have been developed for increasing roads within Ecuadorian protected areas and the Amazon Basin in Peru to gain access to oil and gas reserves [14], [15]. Increased accessibility to natural lands through road development negatively affects wildlife communities [16], [17], [18], [19]. Roads cause direct impacts on wildlife populations by providing access to hunters, introducing mortality through vehicle collisions, limiting animal dispersal, and altering other animal behavior [20], [21], [22], [23]. Additionally, roads initiate cascading effects by promoting colonization processes that lead to habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation [24].
More than 380 indigenous groups live scattered throughout Amazonia, including within protected areas [1], [4]. Many of these peoples persist in landscapes that have maintained high levels of biodiversity, including wildlife species that are important as a source of protein [25]. A variety of factors may have contributed to maintenance of harvested wildlife in these historically occupied lands, such as past low human population densities, lack of technologies allowing intense resource exploitation, subsistence economies that do not use wildlife as a commodity, or other cultural beliefs that favor conservation of biodiversity [26]. Additionally, indigenous hunters have been described as central-place foragers, meaning that they concentrate their activities near settlements [27], [28], [29], [30]. If settlement density remains low, and roads are not built within inhabited protected areas, a central-place forager behavior would facilitate wildlife persistence across the landscape through source-sink dynamics [31]. In a source-sink system, areas with high discrete rates of population increase for wildlife (i.e., λ>1), or sources for wildlife, are connected with areas where wildlife mortality is high (i.e., sinks, λ<1) through animal dispersal [32], [33], [34], [35]. If source areas are large enough, wildlife populations can persist in the sinks.
As roads are built throughout the Amazon Basin, factors that have contributed to maintenance of wildlife in these historically occupied lands are changing rapidly. By facilitating access to markets, roads promote commercial use of wildlife resulting in high pressure on wildlife populations [13], [36], [37]. Additionally, roads may significantly increase the portion of the landscape that is available for harvest and reduce the proportion that remains in source areas or wildlife refugia. Therefore, understanding the impacts of roads on wildlife harvest and trade from a geographical perspective is critical for informing national and international debates on permitting resource extraction in protected areas that currently contain human populations or will be colonized when roads are built [10], [14].
Important questions for wildlife management and conservation in face of increased road networks in Amazonia and other tropical regions are: How do roads affect spatial extent of hunting? How does market vicinity relate to local consumption and trade of bushmeat? How does market accessibility influence choice of game? To answer these questions, we examined hunting practices of the Waorani indigenous group in Yasuní Biosphere Reserve, located in the Amazon region of Ecuador. Yasuní is one of the most biodiverse areas on earth and is under severe pressure to allow increased road development to exploit oil reserves [14], [38]. Many other protected areas across the tropics are facing similar threats [3]. Our results and geographical analyses inform development policies associated with large-scale resource extraction in conservation landscapes inhabited by traditional or indigenous peoples.
