Introduction
The degradation of natural and semi-natural landscapes has become a matter of global concern. This includes habitats in Western and Central Europe [1]–[3]. Semi-natural grasslands are amongst the most species-rich habitat types in Germany [4] but have suffered heavily from changes in land use [5]–[7]. For maintenance and restoration of species-rich grassland communities, adequate management is crucial; in many cases intensification or abandonment leads to a severe reduction in species diversity over the long term [4], [8]–[10]. In the case of abandonment, succession may lead to the development of persistent fallows formed by tall forbs or to a rapid encroachment of woodlands. Specific developments strongly depend on site conditions, initial states of vegetation and neighborhood interactions [11]–[15].
Due to the complex interactions of the many processes driving succession, it is difficult to predict wood encroachment at a specific site. Ecological modeling is considered a potentially powerful tool for ecological forecasting and its application, in the light of the increasing complexity and extent of the environmental problems [16]–[18]. Ecological models can provide an insight into how an ecosystem functions, and the interplay of the underlying key processes, which is essential for successful landscape management [19]. In recent decades, a lot of research has gone into the understanding and simulation of tree establishment and dynamics within closed forests, so that now whole families of forest succession models exist, some of which include the impact of ungulate browsing [20]–[25]. By contrast, models including wood-grassland dynamics have been restricted mainly to arid regions [26], [27]; to our knowledge, only a few models exist that simulate the encroachment of woods upon temperate grasslands in a process-based, spatially explicit way [28]–[30].
In order to assist in decision making when managing the vast semi-natural grassland areas in the Eifel National Park in Western Germany, we built the WoodS-Model as an extension of the previously described GraS-Model (Grassland Succession Model) [31]. The WoodS-Model simulates wood encroachment on grasslands on the landscape scale combining an individual-based (IBM) with a difference equation model. The purpose of this research was thus to develop a dynamic, spatially explicit landscape model, which integrates mutually interacting processes and can be used to predict vegetation development on a particular site. The objective of the current paper is to provide a detailed model description of the simulation of woody species and their interactions with herbaceous species. To simulate the development of the herbaceous species, we used the GraS-Model, which has previously been described and tested [31].
In order to test the model’s predictive capabilities, which is a prerequisite for use in decision making, simulation results are compared with observed vegetation data on the study site, demonstrating that the model is able to emulate successional patterns observed in the field. Additionally, we simulate the landscape development with different population densities of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) and test whether the observed succession can be emulated with the current high browser density on site and whether simulations with lower densities produce plausible results, so that the model can be used to support decision making including wildlife management.
