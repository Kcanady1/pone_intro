Introduction
The rapid urbanization in China in recent decades, accompanied by the continuous increase in urban population and the unprecedented growth of cities, has put significant pressure on urban environments. This pressure has led to severe environmental issues, such as urban heat islands, air pollution, and urban flooding [1]. Moreover, improved economic conditions have lead residents to demand better living environments and a better quality of life.
Urban greenness, represented in this study by all vegetation cover in and around cities, e.g., street plantation, lawns, parks, gardens, crops, wetlands, and forests, contributes valuable ecosystem services and plays an irreplaceable role in the improvement of the urban environment [2]. Urban vegetation improves air quality [3], intercepts storm water runoff [4], reduces energy demands [5], and provides numerous psychological benefits, aesthetic views and restorative opportunities for city dwellers who may otherwise have limited exposure to natural environments [6], [7].
Rapid urbanization has resulted in significant alterations in the quality and quantity of urban greenness [8]. In a large-sample survey involving 386 European cities, green space was found to increase with the city area and slightly decline with the population density [9]. Dallimer et al. indicated that nine out of thirteen cities in England exhibited declining urban green spaces between 2000 and 2008 [10]. Infill development during urbanization is considered to be a major cause of green space loss. Similarly, a statistically significant decline in tree cover was found in many major U.S. cities, along with increased population densities and likely increased development pressure between 2003 and 2009 [11]. Unlike the declining trend reported by the above studies, green space coverage may increase with urbanization intensity. Green space coverage in the built-up areas of Chinese cities, for example, has increased steadily during the last two decades [12]. Yang et al. confirmed the greening trend in larger cities, and they note that rapid urbanization caused a dramatic turnover in vegetation cover [13]. Accurate and timely monitoring of the status of urban greenness is essential for the protection and management of urban environments. Furthermore, characterizing and understanding the trends in urban vegetation cover change provide insights into the relationship between urban greenness and urbanization and can help guide sustainable urban development [14].
As an important source of urban information, remote sensing data provide a spatially consistent coverage of large areas with both high spatial detail and high temporal frequency [15]. With the increased availability of current and historical remotely sensed data and new analytical techniques, it is now possible to quantify urban greenness in a timely and cost-effective manner [16], [17]. Despite the increasing application of high-resolution images, medium-resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat and SPOT) is still the preferred data source. Specifically, medium-resolution imagery is globally available, and it uniquely composes the only long-term, consistent digital dataset. However, commonly used detection techniques, such as the calculation of classification and vegetation indices from medium spatial resolution imagery, may be ineffective in quantifying physically fine-resolution information related to urban greenness. The urban environment is highly heterogeneous and complex, resulting in the mixed pixel problem [18], [19]. Because the status and variation of urban greenness typically occur at finer spatial scales than most moderate resolution imagery, the vegetation in a pixel can only be recorded as either present or absent with traditional hard classifiers, resulting in a loss of information on isolated vegetation and within-class variation [20], [21]. However, the status of and subtle change in urban greenness are highly related to the urban environment and significantly affect local residents' quality of life. The specific characteristics of the urban landscape require further consideration regarding the capabilities and limitations of remote sensing data and the use of appropriate analysis techniques [22], [23].
A variety of approaches has been developed to overcome the mixed pixel problem in urban landscapes. Spectral mixture analysis techniques (SMA and MESMA) [24] have been widely utilized to estimate the proportion of representative urban land cover within each pixel because of their ability to support the repeatable and accurate extraction of quantitative subpixel information with physical meaning [25], [26]. To date, a considerable number of studies have utilized this method to characterize urban compositions [18], [27], [28], map urban vegetation [16], [19], [29], and monitor urban changes [30], [31], [32], [33]. However, only a few multi-temporal studies have employed these techniques to monitor long-term changes in urban greenness [34]. Given the sharp growth in urban areas in China in terms of area and intensity, it is imperative to analyze the pattern of vegetation cover change within Chinese cities.
Taking Hangzhou, one of the most rapidly urbanizing cities in eastern China, this paper proposes a feasible and cost-effective greenness change detection method in highly-fragmented urban environment by integrating multi-date remote sensing, MESMA and GIS spatial analysis. Specifically, this paper explores the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolution of greenness in response to the rapid urbanization process in the past two decades (1990â€“2010) aiming to improve the understanding of the effects of urbanization on greenness patterns and provide basic information for appropriate decision-making towards urban sustainable development.
