Introduction
Non-Newtonian fluids are widely used in industries such as chemicals, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food and oil & gas [1]. Due to their numerous applications several scientists and engineers are working on them. Despite of the fact non-Newtonian fluids are not as easy as Newtonian fluids. It is due to the fact that in non-Newtonian fluids there does not exist a single constitutive relation that can be used to explain all of them. Therefore several constitutive equations or models are introduced to study their characteristics. The different non-Newtonian models include power law [2], second grade [3], Jeffrey [4], Maxwell [5], viscoplastic [6], Bingham plastic [7], Brinkman type [8], Oldroyd-B [9] and Walters-B [10] models. However, there is another model known as Casson model which is recently the most popular one. Casson [11] was the first who introduce this model for the prediction of the flow behavior of pigment oil suspensions of the printing ink type. Later on, several researchers studied Casson fluid for different flow situations and configurations. Amongst them, Mustafa et al. [12] studied the unsteady flow and heat transfer of a Casson fluid past a moving flat plate. Rao et al. [13] considered the thermal and hydrodynamic slip conditions on heat transfer flow of a Casson fluid past a semi-infinite vertical plate. Heat transfer flow of a Casson fluid past a permeable shrinking sheet with viscous dissipation was considered by Qasim and Noreen [14]. Recently, forced convection flow of a Casson fluid past with surface heat flux over a symmetric porous wedge was investigated by Mukhopadhyay and Mandal [15]. Few other attempts for the Casson fluid can also be found in [16]–[21].
In all these studies mentioned above, the Newtonian heating condition was neglected at the boundary. The situation where the heat is transported to the convective fluid via a bounding surface having finite heat capacity is known as Newtonian heating (or conjugate convective flows). This configuration occurs in convection flows set up when the bounding surfaces absorb heat by solar radiation. Merkin [22] in his pioneering work studied the free convection boundary layer flow past a vertical plate with Newtonian heating. He found the asymptotic solution near the leading edge analytically and the full solution along the whole plate for free convection boundary layer over vertical surfaces numerically. On the other hand, the Newtonian heating situation occurs in many important engineering devices, such as heat exchanger and conjugate heat transfer around fins. Therefore, in view of such applications several authors have used the Newtonian heating condition in their convective heat transfer problems and have obtained the solutions either numerically [23]–[26] or analytical forms [27]–[33].
Most of the existing studies on unsteady boundary layer flow and heat transfer with Newtonian heating condition are limited to the Newtonian fluid or they are solved using any numerical or approximate technique. This motivates us to consider the Newtonian heating phenomenon in the present work for non-Newtonian fluids. More exactly, our aim is to investigate unsteady boundary layer flow and heat transfer of a Casson fluid past an infinite oscillating vertical plate with Newtonian heating condition. The equations of the problem are first formulated and then transformed into their dimensionless forms where the Laplace transform method is applied to find the exact solutions for velocity and temperature.
