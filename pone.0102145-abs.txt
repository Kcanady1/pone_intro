Introduction
Suicide is a significant public health problem worldwide. It is the second leading cause of death for Canadian youth aged 10–24. Each year, on average, 294 youths die from suicide [1]. A recent report indicated that Eastern Ontario has a suicide attempt rate two times greater than the provincial average (6.78 vs. 2.96 per 1,000) [2]. Females aged 15 to 19 years in Eastern Ontario have a 50 per cent higher rate of suicide than the rest of the province. These alarming data support the crucial need for research data to understand the determinants of suicide and suicidal behaviour among children and adolescents. Experience of bullying victimization is one of many possible determinants of suicidal ideation and suicide-related behaviours.
Bullying – an aggressive behaviour that is intentional, repeated, and involves a power imbalance [3] – is a major public health concern. Despite the efforts of schools to prevent or stop bullying, bullying is still highly prevalent worldwide [4], [5]. Information and communication technology (ICT) has emerged as a recent vehicle for peer aggression worldwide. Cyberbullying has been defined as the use of email, cell phones, text messages, and Internet sites to threaten, harass, embarrass, or socially exclude [6], [7]. That is, cyberbullying provides to perpetrators the benefit of lack of face-to-face contact. It is more pervasive than traditional bullying, as it can happen anytime and anywhere. Consequently, bullying which usually takes place in school is now also occurring at home [8], [9], [10]. Among features that may distinguish cyberbullying from traditional bullying, the anonymity afforded to perpetrators and the limitless potential audience consisting of bystanders and observers are even more redoubtable [8], [11]. The inability for victims to have any control over acts of cyberbullying may result in feelings of powerlessness in the person being bullied [12]. As a result, the damage experienced in cyberbullying may be largely social and emotional in nature and is exacerbated by the intensity of the threats inflicted [12].
The growing number of cyberbullying victims over the past decade and the deleterious effects of cyberbullying on victims are of great concern. Several studies have shown that traditional bullying among youths is associated with depression, suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicidal behaviour [13], [14]. However, the psychological outcomes of cyberbullying remain inconsistent and unclear, probably because of its recent development. While some authors think that the consequences of cyberbullying tend to parallel those of traditional bullying [4], [11], others believe that cyberbullying may be even more psychologically distressing than regular school bullying [12]. An emerging body of research has begun to identify an association between cyberbullying and mental health problems. Several correlates have been identified among victims of cyberbullying, such as increased depression, suicidal ideation, and non-fatal suicidal behaviour (suicide attempts) [4], [15], [16].
The psychological mechanisms underlying the association between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation and suicide-related behaviours are less well understood. According to Agnew's social psychological strain theory of deviance, strained social relationships and events pressure individuals into committing deviant acts [17]. Bullying is known to be a source of strain [18], [19]. It makes victims feel angry and frustrated, therefore putting them more at risk to engage in deviant behaviours. From this, it can be reasoned that bullying victims are at an increased risk of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts as coping responses to their victimization. Since depression is a well known risk factor for suicidal behaviour [20], it may therefore be accounted for in these causal chains as victims may first endure episodes of depression before progressing to suicidal ideation, plans and attempts (Figure 1). Based on the nature and intensity of threats and individual vulnerability of the victim, cyberbullying and school bullying may directly result in suicidal ideation, plans and attempts (Path C, Figure 1).

Bauman et al. [21] have recently documented the mediating role of depression on the association between bullying victimization and suicide attempts among American high school student girls using data from the 2009 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS). However, their analyses were not adjusted for covariates and potential confounders reported in the literature to be associated with experience of bullying victimization and/or report of suicide attempts such as substance use [20], [22], [23], sedentary activities [24], and also importantly the amount of time spent on a computer [25], inasmuch as the experience of cyberbullying depends, at least in part, on the use of Internet. Thus, the independent effects (direct or indirect pathways) of bullying victimization on suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicidal behaviour controlling for other risks behaviours are not clear.
The purpose of the current study was to (1) examine the association between cyberbullying and school bullying victimization with suicidal ideation, plans and attempts among middle and high school students, as well as (2) test whether the presence of depression mediates these associations. We hypothesized that cyberbullying and school bullying victimization results in higher likelihood of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts, and that depression would mediate these relationships, while controlling for sociodemographic variables, substance use, sedentary activities, and the amount of time spent on the computer.
