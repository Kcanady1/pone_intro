Introduction
How might the phenomenon of individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, who share their illness experiences through video narratives uploaded onto platforms like YouTube constitute the development of a naturally emerging peer support system? Or does this activity represent a risky process of self-exposure, and susceptibility to negative comments, unsolicited content, or exposure to harmful influences of others?
YouTube is a video-sharing website created in 2005 that is currently the third most popular social media website worldwide after Facebook and Google+ [1]. YouTube has videos uploaded in 61 different languages, and reaches more adults ages 18–34 in the United States than any cable network [2]. YouTube is free to use, and any individual with access to the Internet can upload videos, post comments, or share videos with others. While the potential harms and benefits of connecting with others to share health information through social media have been discussed extensively [3]–[5], diverse patient groups with sensitive health conditions are increasingly turning to social media websites like YouTube to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar conditions [4], [6]. As people with diverse health conditions seek greater online connectivity, it is not clear whether YouTube may represent a platform by which individuals with SMI can provide and receive peer support or whether unforeseen risks might prevent such support.
Peer support in SMI includes a system of mutual giving and receiving where individuals who have faced and endured the adversity of mental illness can offer hope, companionship, and encouragement to others facing similar conditions [7], [8]. Peer support has been recognized as a promising strategy for mental health recovery and for overcoming limitations of illness [7]–[10]. However, much of the literature has focused on formal peer support programs delivered within community settings such as mental health centers or psychosocial clubhouses, as well as through Internet support groups, or provided in conjunction with existing evidence-based practices [8], [10]–[12]. Less attention has been given to informal peer-to-peer relationships spanning an individual’s community, surroundings, personal life, and social network [13]. Also, with the increasing popularity of social media and its growing importance as a means to connect and interact with others, there is a need to consider whether informal peer support naturally occurs outside of professional services and across a popular social media website such as YouTube.
Evidence suggests individuals with SMI are more likely to share personal views through blogging, build friendships on social media [14], and use the Internet for accessing health information [15] than people without mental illness. This could be in part because social media is perceived as a non-threatening medium that provides opportunities to identify and connect with similar individuals within the safety of one’s own home. Yet, uncertainty exists on how social media might be used for online peer support among individuals with SMI [16]. Our search of relevant literature did not identify any studies that characterize or explore types of social interactions or discussion content between peers with SMI on social media websites. Therefore an exploration of these interactions and how they might represent naturally occurring peer support among individuals with SMI is needed.
In the context of YouTube, groups of individuals with diverse health conditions, including multiple sclerosis [17], inflammatory bowel disease [18], or cancer [19], use this platform as a tool for searching for health information [20] and as a forum for sharing personal illness stories or receiving feedback and social support from others. For example, analyses of videos on YouTube generated by people with multiple sclerosis and corresponding comments demonstrate that many individuals frequently disclose personal health information in this online environment [21], and upload videos to provide treatment advice to others and share personal experiences seeking and obtaining medical care [17]. With evidence documenting the widespread use of YouTube among numerous patient groups, in the current study we aim to explore comments posted to YouTube by individuals who self-identify as having a SMI, taking the perspective that naturally occurring peer support through social media may be beneficial. Our objective is to observe how individuals with SMI interact on YouTube with their peers, knowing the risks of disclosure, and whether this might serve as a way to manage their own recovery and provide support to others.
First, to investigate this phenomenon of growing social media use among individuals with SMI, we provide a brief conceptual background to frame peer support and social media within the context of SMI. We then outline our process of exploring the comments associated with uploaded YouTube videos for expressions of peer support. Our analysis details how individuals with SMI use YouTube to interact with each other, and our discussion reflects the value of this popular social media website as a naturally occurring peer support platform.

Peer Support and Severe Mental Illness
Peer support in psychiatry has its roots in the mental health consumer movement of the 1970s, where individuals living with SMI campaigned for basic human rights, mental health care reform, and the right to make their own health care choices [8], [22]. These advocacy efforts were in large part a protest against discrimination and injustices, including authoritarian psychiatric practices, compulsory hospitalizations, and coercion to undergo unproven treatments [23]. This activism led to collective action, and to the development of mutual support and self-help activities [8]. Central tenets of peer support in mental health include reciprocity, mutual respect, and shared responsibility [7]. For this highly stigmatized group [24], peer support offers optimism and hope for a better life and acceptance as well as opportunities to relate to one another through common experiences and shared struggles [25]. Relationships between peers are based upon commitment to positive personal growth and wider contribution to community building toward achieving mental health recovery [7].
Recent decades have seen the emergence and demonstrated effectiveness of formal peer provided services [11] including programs targeting mental health recovery [26], medical illness self-management [27], [28], and smoking cessation [29]. These programs are often guided by conventional therapeutic boundaries [25], and are delivered in an organized manner involving formal providers or in conjunction with prescribed medical and mental health services [13]. Structured programs fall in between natural and therapeutic relationships, and differ from informal peer support [25].
Informal peer support relationships are considered the foundation of peer support in mental health [30], and occur naturally between individuals who come together through shared experience. Informal peer support creates a sense of belonging and friendship [30], and allows individuals with SMI to feel greater self-worth and self-efficacy by supporting and impacting the life of another peer [25]. However, peers who provide support can also become overwhelmed or frustrated consistent with caregiver distress, or face interpersonal conflicts due to the burden of managing their own symptoms and mental health concerns [25]. As with any informal interactions, recommendations or advice provided by peers are based upon personal experiences, which at times might contradict professional recommendations or the content of structured programs. Despite these concerns, the benefits of informal peer support in SMI are widely accepted [7], [8].

Social Media and Peer Support
Social media websites have afforded new opportunities for individuals to connect with others, provide and receive support, and share their illness experiences [4]. There are disease specific support groups on Facebook [31], [32], personal video logs posted by patients onto YouTube [21], and entire interactive forums dedicated to sharing illness experiences such as PatientsLikeMe [33]. Despite this widely reported use among the general population, use of popular social media among individuals with SMI has received less attention.
Evidence suggests that individuals with SMI create online relationships at the same rate [34] or higher when compared to individuals without a mental illness [14]. A case study examined the therapeutic benefit of using Facebook to reach an isolated patient with psychiatric comorbidities and foster social relationships [35]. Ethical considerations related to suicidal postings to Facebook among individuals with SMI, including privacy concerns and threats to the therapeutic alliance, have also been explored [36]. However, no prior studies have highlighted any specific risks of social media use among individuals with SMI that extend beyond what would be observed in general patient populations.
Social media may be well suited for peer support among individuals with SMI. These websites facilitate natural community building, where control of entry and exit are independent of social interaction, which allows users to avoid the anxiety and fears associated with face-to-face interactions [34]. With relative anonymity, individuals with SMI can find peers and discuss aspects of living with mental illness in a controlled and personal environment by using the Internet from home [37]. Also, individuals who are stigmatized because of their illness are often highly motivated to seek others with the same condition [38], something that social media can enable.
To date, however, the benefits and understanding the why and motivation of online peer support in SMI have not been established. We know that disclosure of personal information through social media has been linked to individual behavioral control [39] and psychological well-being [40]. One study [16] of unmediated online peer support for individuals with psychiatric disabilities, comparing a listserv and a bulletin board, replicated the spontaneous nature of Internet forums. The authors’ found many participants reported both positive experiences and greater distress, suggesting that online peer support may not deliver all intended benefits [16]. The uncertainty of these findings underscores the need to more fully explore the interactions between individuals with SMI on a popular social media website like YouTube to gain insight about informal peer support relationships and to observe whether harms or benefits emerge within an unmonitored and public online platform.
