Introduction
Crowd stampedes happen not rarely in religious gatherings, music concerts, earthquakes or in other panic situations [1]–[3]. Recently in the literature, there emerge a great number of researches on the modeling of the behavior of pedestrians [4]–[7], such as queueing theoretical approaches [8], fluid-dynamic models [9]–[11], the social force model [2], [12]–[14], cellular automata [15]–[18], and multi-agent approaches [19], [20]. The social force model is a widely used approach [14], [21]–[25], that can model many observed collective behaviors, such as “stop-and-go”, “faster is slower”, “arching and clogging” [12], [26].
Architectural design can either facilitate or hamper the escape process in panic situations. To do this, some interesting obstacle placements were studied [12], [23], [25], [27]–[31], and the literature indicates that it is possible to increase the outflow by suitably placing an obstacle or some other shaped obstacles in front of the exit. Unsuitable obstacles, however, will slow down the flow rather than increase it. Although many researchers have already performed a significant amount of work on how to control the pedestrian flow and to maximize the escape speed in panic situations, there is no very simple but particularly effective approach to achieve the goal.
Helbing et al. [2] suggested that the obstacle may behave like a wave breaker to absorb the pressure in the crowd and to reduce it to a subcritical level. They observed the clogging effect in a pushy crowd with approximately 20 participants, while the placement of one obstacle increased the efficiency of escape. Zuriguel et al. [30] proposed that the physical mechanism behind the clogging reduction is a pressure decrease in the region of arch formation. Escobar et al. [25] compared different shaped obstacles for their ability to enhance the outflow efficiency, and pillar(s) were found to be the most efficient and the simplest design. Yanagisawa et al. [29] studied efficiency of escape with an obstacle on hexagonal cell space with human experiments and Shiwakoti et al. [22] performed a series of experiments with ants to enhance the panic escape of crowd through architectural design. Although these papers [2], [22], [23], [25], [29], [30] show clearly that pillar is a simple and effective shape of obstacle, none of them told us what is the best layout of the obstacles. Both Johansson [26] and Shukla [28] used a genetic algorithm to optimize the layout of the obstacles. Their works demonstrated that a genetic algorithm is an efficient tool for solving such types of problems. In [26], they claimed that the “useless channel” in the architecture design “has obviously no negative effect on the flow”. However, this design sacrifices the pedestrians in the “useless channel” to rescue the others, which we regard as unacceptable and unfair to the pedestrians in it.
People with an experience of running to catch a bus during rush hour in large and crowded cities such as Beijing may have the experience that people pushing from the middle are comparatively less successful to get on board the bus than those people pushing from the sides. This experience provides us with the heuristics required to study the property that benefits the people who push from the sides. Intuitively stated, the people pushing from the middle are “blocked” by the force coming from aside, which we call here the tangential momentum that will be defined in Simulation Results section. This is like the case when you pull out two balls from a bottle. When you pull out the balls one by one, the force is along the pulling rope and you can finish the task easily. When you pull them out simultaneously, the two balls interact with tangential force that is perpendicular to the pulling rope that gets them stuck. We make an assumption that the property that reduces the escape speed in a panic situation is the tangential momentum. If this assumption is true, to increase the escape speed is to find a better layout design of a room that can reduce the tangential momentum.
In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to provide the layout design of the obstacles (pillars) that can reduce the tangential momentum, the settings and parameters for the simulation are extracted from human experiments. The human experiments are used as a test of the simulated optimal layout to see whether the layout can speed up the escape. The model, on the other hand, is a prediction of the experiments, provided the simulated escape time corresponds well with the experiment outcomes.
