Introduction
Palliative care encompasses assessment and relief of suffering of all kinds including pain, other physical and psychological symptoms, and social distress along the entire course of the patient’s disease process [1]. Palliative care has been shown to improve patient outcomes, including mortality, when integrated with disease-modifying therapy [2]. The integration of palliative care with routine treatment for HIV/AIDS, cancer and other serious chronic illnesses is an important strategy for increasing access to palliative care and improving the quality of health care [3]–[6]. Despite the documented benefits, however, access to comprehensive, integrated palliative care remains limited in most developing countries, where the global burden of chronic disease is greatest [7], [8].
Worldwide, 80% of patients lack access to adequate pain control–the cornerstone of palliative care [9]. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), only 5% of people in need of palliative care receive it despite the growing availability of palliative care programs [10]. The demand for palliative care in SSA is expected to increase over the next 20 years as more persons living with HIV (PLHIV) access life-prolonging antiretroviral therapy (ART) and develop long-term complications of HIV disease, and as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer, become more prevalent [10]–[12].
Malawi, a densely populated sub-Saharan African country with low per capita health expenditure, offers palliative care services at 21 sites–a fraction of the over 600 public and non-governmental health facilities located throughout the country [13], [14]. Despite recent increases in palliative care service availability, major challenges remain in making these services accessible to all Malawians in need, particularly in rural areas. Geographical coverage of palliative care remains concentrated in urban and peri-urban locales, often out of reach for the 80% of the population who reside in less densely populated areas [15]–[18]. In rural settings where health infrastructure and human resources are limited, HIV and NCDs strain the capacity of health systems to deliver palliative care services. Based on recent estimates, over 1 million Malawians are living with HIV/AIDS and more than 25,000 have cancer [13], [19], [20]. Many Malawian patients and their family caregivers endure these illnesses at home–where they may prefer to receive care. Yet their needs, knowledge, and preferences regarding palliative care are not well characterized.
Qualitative research provides insight into palliative care needs, knowledge, and preferences, identifies causes of suffering, and guides local responses to recognized needs [16], [21]–[25]. Available evidence from SSA indicates that the greatest needs of patients facing serious chronic illnesses and their caregivers may be psychosocial with basic socioeconomic necessities–including food, adequate shelter, and help with school fees–featuring prominently [1], [16]. However, few published accounts describe palliative care needs, knowledge, and preferences in rural areas [1], [26]–[27]. Fewer still detail efforts to translate identified needs into programmatic action and describe effective models of palliative care service delivery, particularly community- and home-based models that integrate palliative care with health services relevant to the SSA context, including treatment for HIV/AIDS [26], [28]–[29].
Since 2007, Partners In Health (PIH), a non-governmental organization based in Boston, USA, has partnered with its Malawian sister organization, Abwenzi Pa Za Umoyo (APZU), and the Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) to provide comprehensive healthcare to the people of Neno, a rural and impoverished district in the country’s Southern region. In early 2012, APZU/PIH launched the Neno Palliative Care Program (NPCP) in order to integrate pain and symptom relief and psychosocial support with disease modifying treatment for patients with serious chronic illnesses and their families. As part of APZU/PIH’s ongoing palliative care work, we conducted a situation analysis of the palliative care needs, knowledge, preferences, and services available in Neno district, aiming to improve the NPCP in a manner responsive to identified needs. We report here the results of the situation analysis, including early outcomes from the NPCP.
