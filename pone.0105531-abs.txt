Introduction
As we expand our knowledge on cell signaling, it becomes increasingly clear that the complexity of the cellular systems cannot be fully understood through the investigation of isolated molecules, but as a function that emerges from a molecular network temporally and spatially highly orchestrated [1], [2]. Therefore, the comprehension of cellular systems requires a systems biology approach, which includes not only the identification of their components, but also the study of the systems structures and dynamics, and the mechanisms that control and modify their properties [3]. The systems-level approach has been used successfully in the investigation of several different processes in which the complexity of the molecular interactions challenges their understanding through classical reductionist approaches [4]. Among these processes is the olfactory transduction and adaptation, two key cellular events involved in odorant reception and in its consequences for finding food, avoiding predators, identifying sexual partners and other relevant aspects of animal survival [5]–[7].
The olfactory information is transmitted through the signaling pathways located in the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Odorants bind to G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) triggering the activation of Gαolf that in turn activates adenylate cyclase 3 (AC3) producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [8]. Molecules of cAMP bind to cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels promoting their opening and allowing cations, mainly sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) ions, to flow to the intracellular medium depolarizing the cell. This transient increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) opens Ca2+-activated chloride (CAC) channels that amplify the CNG channel signal [9].
The OSN adapts after a previous exposure to stimulus. Short-term adaptation (STA) is defined as a decrease in responsiveness to the odor presentation that occurs within a few seconds after a brief conditioning stimulus. Previous works have shown that STA is induced by a brief odor pulse, has a recovery time of seconds, and can be abolished by the removal of intracellular Ca2+ [10]. Moreover, experimental and theoretical evidences have demonstrated that STA happens at the level of CNG channel [11] and presumably is independent of the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze cAMP terminating its action [12]. However, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms involving PDEs may act by modulating the concentration of cAMP with consequences for STA [13], [14]. Additionally, Ca2+/Calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) can bind to CNG channels, promoting a decrease in its affinity to cAMP [15], a process that seems to be involved in STA. Since cAMP opens CNG channels leading to Ca2+ influx that induces STA [11], Ca2+ extrusion mainly through Na+/Ca2+ and K+ exchangers (NCKX) [16]–[18] and, possibly, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCA) [19]–[22] leads to the resetting the cellular resting state. There are evidences that K+-independent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) and NCKX are present in mammalian OSNs [23], [24].
Another mechanism controlling intracellular concentrations of cAMP is the internalization of GPCRs mediated by phosphorylation catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) [25] and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) [26], [27], but the specific role of GPCR cycling in the occurrence of STA is unknown. In addition, although cAMP and Ca2+ are involved in STA, it is uncertain how their regulation by distinct signaling pathways affects the recovery times of OSN responses to odorants.
The decrease in OSN sensitivity can occur not only in the presence of a brief conditioning stimulus, but also in the presence of a prolonged stimulus. The decline in OSN response produced by a sustained odor pulse is defined as desensitization (DS). The molecular mechanism behind the occurrence of DS likely act upstream of cAMP production and involves Ca2+ dependent pathways [28].
The present study uses pharmacological manipulation of signaling pathways involved in STA accessed by electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses to paired pulses of odorant to investigate the action of PDE, PKA, and vesicle internalization and recycling in the fine control of olfactory adaptation. In addition, we have developed a stochastic kinetic model of STA to gain insights on its dynamical aspects. Previous attempts for modeling olfactory transduction and adaptation in OSNs have generated important conceptual advances in the field [29]–[37]. However, the overwhelming accumulation of experimental data constantly challenging our comprehension of this system urges for a unifying approach to achieve a better understanding of olfactory transduction and adaptation. In this way, we have developed a stochastic kinetic model strongly constrained by the available experimental parameters that incorporates detailed kinetic schemes of binding, gating, desensitization and inactivation of CNG and CAC channels along with the dynamics of their ligands, cAMP and Ca2+. The model simulates the occurrence of STA in the noise environment of a single olfactory cilium [38], [39] and demonstrates how it promotes the EOG signal. Thus, the model was used for the interpretation of measured drug effects on the odorant responses in the intact olfactory epithelium. The results obtained with the stochastic kinetic model and the pharmacological experiments indicate that STA is not only controlled by desensitization of CNG channels through Ca2+/CaM, but also by desensitization and resensitization of GPCRs regulated through signaling pathways that are involved in vesicle cycling.
