Introduction
The tremendous advancement of sequencing technologies combined with rapid reductions in associated costs has allowed researchers not only to sequence more diverse organisms but also to sample individual bacterial species with much greater resolution. Extensive strain sequencing has led to the realization and appreciation that most bacterial species harbour enormous genomic diversity among strains [1]–[10] This diversity is manifested in small scale as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and also the more dramatic swapping in and out of entire genes and/or operons through the process of horizontal gene transfer as predicted by the Distributed Genome Hypothesis [11]–[12]. Analyses of multiple genomes from individual bacterial species have led to the recognition that there exists a supragenome [11], [13] or pan-genome [1] at the species-level that is far larger than the genome of any single strain. The supragenome is composed of the core genome (those genes shared among all strains, and the distributed/accessory genome (those genes that are present in only a subset of strains). The ability to take up and incorporate DNA from the distributed genome by sampling from other strains’ DNA during polyclonal infections has been hypothesized to give these organisms an important mechanism for rapid diversity generation [11], [14]–[17]. This genetic diversity manifests as phenotypic diversity as different strains within the same species have been found to possess enormous differences in complex processes such as quorum sensing, biofilm formation and pathogenesis [12], [17]–[21] (Janto et al., Kress-Bennett et al. unpublished observations).
Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is one such species of bacteria that has been demonstrated to possess enormous genomic variability [2], [5], [22]. These bacteria are commensals of the human respiratory tract but some have pathogenic potential. Un-encapsulated non-typeable Hi (NTHi) are most often associated with localized disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [23]–[27], otorrhea [21], chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and acute otitis media (AOM) [27]–[33], however, they are increasingly being found as the major source of invasive disease [34]–[38]. Individual NTHi strains share only ∼80% of their ∼1,800 genes with all other strains (core genes) with the rest being distributed (or accessory) genes [2]. The Finite Supragenome Model [2], [5] predicts the Hi supragenome to contain 4547 genes of which only ∼33% represent the core genome while the rest are present at various other frequencies among strains within the species [22]. The tremendous genic variability among NTHi strains presents a significant challenge when studying whole genome transcriptional patterns among many different strains. Traditionally, genic content must be known a priori in order to target genes with sequence-specific probes for measurement. Since two different strains might at a minimum share only the core genes, an array of probes designed for genes found in any single strain does not appropriately represent the species and therefore a significant amount of information will be lost (hundreds of genes) when using an array developed from a single strain. Thus, a more robust strategy for the design of bacterial microarrays is to use probes based on defined supragenomic sequences.
We previously designed and tested an H. influenzae supragenome hybridization (SGH) array in order to perform DNA-DNA hybridizations for the purpose of determining gene content in unsequenced strains [22]. This array was designed based on 3,100 genes that were identified in whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 24 geographically and clinically diverse NTHi strains and which includes >98% of all non-rare (ν>0.1) genes. Since genes are either present or absent from genomic DNA (gDNA) of any given strain, the signal obtained for each probe is essentially binary and a signal threshold cut-off was used to determine whether a gene was present or not. Nevertheless the data collected is quantitative and these arrays can also be used to hybridize labelled RNA instead of DNA thereby acting as a transcriptomic tool. Here we report the testing and validation of these custom SGH arrays for this application, as well as the design of an analysis pipeline for suggested use.
