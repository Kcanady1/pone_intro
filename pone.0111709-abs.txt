Introduction
Overweight and obesity have become worldwide health problems because they cause several diseases [1]–[4]. In response, various disciplines, particularly the health sciences, have focused on variations in human body mass and composition [5]–[9], particularly on factors that lead to increases in human body mass [10]–[15]. Mathematical models and their numerical solutions can be used to quantify changes in body mass and are therefore useful tools for studying body mass. Caloric intake and total energy expenditure are two of the most important and complex factors that should be quantified [16], [17]. Our aim in the present study is to propose a set of formulas as a function of individual body mass and implement them to estimate how body mass varies over time. Then, a random variation is introduced to represent variations in the caloric intake and energy expenditure from those for the daily routine of an individual; this variation provides a simple method of accounting for social interactions.
