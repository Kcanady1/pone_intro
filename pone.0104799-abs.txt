Introduction
Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are a key cultural [1], ecological [2], and economic [3] driver in southeast Alaska with global socio-ecological value [4], [5]. In a recent study by the U.S. Forest Service, 96% of Alaskans said that salmon are essential to the Alaskan way of life [6]. More than 50 species of animals feed on spawning salmon each year, and 1 in 10 jobs in southeast Alaska is supported by salmon [6]. Yearly salmon productivity has varied considerably by species and watershed—the regional productivity has remained relatively resilient [3], although the influence of hatchery enhancements on wild salmon stocks is of concern [7]–[9]. Sustained production and harvest opportunities are likely the result of a portfolio effect [10] whereby thousands of watersheds and tens-of-thousands of streams provide a diversity of freshwater habitats, promoting phenotypic diversity, which buffers regional salmon returns against variability in ocean [11], near-shore [12], and freshwater conditions [13]. Looking to the future, predicted hydrologic change associated with climate change may very well present the biggest challenge to Pacific Salmon conservation and management in the 21st Century [13]–[20].
Southeast Alaska is predicted to experience the largest change in winter days above freezing in all of North America due to climate change [21]. While boreal and arctic Alaska is expected to see the largest changes in absolute temperature [22], a small increase in temperature in southeast Alaska could have transformative ecological effects (e.g., [23]–[27]). The mean winter temperature is currently near freezing at −4°C [28]; therefore, with a relatively small increase in temperature, many watersheds and portions of sub-basins will no longer receive winter precipitation as snow, and will transition into rain-fed systems. Many watersheds will likely see decreased total snowpack in headwaters that have provided water storage and moderated flows for salmon streams throughout the summer, and maintained cooler summer stream temperatures [17], [25], [26].
Watersheds of southeast Alaska can be generally categorized into three hydrologic types: (1) rain-fed, (2) snow-fed, and (3) glacial [29]. Each hydrologic type is expected to exhibit a spectrum of change associated with climate change [17], [18], [29] and provide unique challenges to resident salmon population adaptation [16], [30]. In general, rain-fed systems will likely see increased winter flows, reduced summer flows, and higher stream temperatures all year [16], [17], [19], [20]. Snow-fed systems will likely see more variable discharge patterns with increased rain-on-snow events that can cause flooding, an earlier spring melt, and some may transition into rain-fed hydrologic types due to loss of adequate headwater snowpack [17], [29], [31]. Glacial systems will likely see increased discharge year-round (until some systems lose glaciers altogether), generally colder summer stream temperatures while glaciers are still present, and warmer winter water temperatures [24], [32]–[35].
Pacific Salmon are affected by hydroclimatic factors at every stage of their lifecycle. Starting with egg incubation in freshwater habitats, water temperatures have the greatest effect on development rates [36]. In addition, winter flow extremes can scour salmon eggs from mobile spawning substrates (i.e., smaller gravels) and cause increased sedimentation that eliminates or degrades habitat by reducing oxygenation [19]. Emergent fry and juvenile salmonids require adequate stream flows to maintain high quality, protected off-channel habitats in both summer and winter to support growth and survival [36]. Smolt migration requires adequate stream flows and appropriate temperature cues to reach estuarine rearing habitats in synchrony with high food availability in the near-shore marine environment [37], [38]. Development and spawning success during the adult life-phase is in-turn dependent on global ocean circulation patterns, feed availability, and adequate stream flows and suitable temperatures for return migration and spawning [36].
A review of the current literature suggests egg-to-fry lifestage survival under projected climate change may be one of the most important limiting factors for salmon productivity and conservation in southeast Alaska freshwater habitats [15], [18], [19], [27], [29]. Recent studies in Washington State have detailed information on air-to-stream water temperature relationships [19], extreme flow events, and survival estimates [15]; population modeling studies thus far suggest egg-to-fry survival may be a key limiting factor under a range of climate change scenarios for the Pacific Northwest [15]—in addition to a suite of temperature related factors that may be less of a concern to salmon in northern parts of their range [17]. However, summer habitat conditions warrant further research in southeast Alaska [17], [38]. Washington State also has generally larger river systems that are more affected by climate model predictions for drier, hotter summers for interior parts of the state [19]. Southeast Alaska's mostly small and steep watersheds may behave more like the Olympic Peninsula watersheds where the scouring of eggs due to winter flooding events is currently thought to be more of concern than summer habitat conditions (e.g., [27]). Warmer winter water temperatures in southeast Alaska may accelerate salmon development rates, increase off-channel rearing habitats, and improve productivity in some watersheds (e.g., moderately glacial systems) in northern parts of their range [17], [36], [38]; this has been evidenced by increased salmon catch records during the warm-phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in Alaska (PDO; [26]). However, depending on specific watershed physiographic characteristics (e.g., mean elevation, slope, and floodplain viability), stream channel geomorphology, genetic diversity, and capacity for phenotypic plasticity [16], [20], [30], [39], directionally changing flow regimes will likely transition into less favorable habitats due to more frequent scouring events in segments of some watersheds [15].
Two primary questions were asked in this paper: (1) effects of future projection trends in temperature and precipitation on seasonal discharge patterns across southeast Alaska, and (2) vulnerability or resilience of watersheds to hydrologic change in relation to the current distribution of high-value salmon habitat. The project was conducted in five phases: (1) development of a comprehensive historical stream gauge station database for the region; (2) development of a transboundary geospatial database of watershed physiographic and climatic characteristics for historical and projected temperature and precipitation; (3) building and testing multiple regression-based monthly discharge models using AIC model selection; (4) mapping the regional discharge model results for projected change during the spawning and incubation period (September to March), and; (5) combining a climate change sensitivity index with an index of current salmon habitat and species diversity to develop a research and conservation priority matrix.
