Introduction
Small-world phenomenon [1] has been a focus of research of social sciences for decades. While many different types of random graphs exist with the property of having short path lengths between pairs of nodes [2], [3], finding these nodes, in general, can prove hard and usually requires global information about the network. Geographically embedded networks, on the other hand, usually make it possible to find routes between pairs of nodes based on local information only, a property called navigability [4]. In the original experiments of Milgram [1], [5], randomly chosen individuals living in the mid-western USA were asked to deliver a letter to a given address in Boston but they were only allowed to forward it directly to personal acquaintances. Although the results were widely popularized as the phenomenon of six degrees of separation, in reality, the mean length of shortest paths between persons in social networks is even less [6]. By examining the strategy of the individuals taking part in the experiment, Travers & Milgram found that people were most likely to forward the letter to an acquaintance thought to be living the closest to the target address.
With the increasing availability of social network data, the results of Travers & Milgram gained revived attention. Dodds & Watts investigated models of routing on social networks [7] and carried out experiments similar to that of Travers & Milgram using email communication instead of letters [8]. In his seminal paper, Kleinberg showed theoretically [4], [9] for an important family of random networks embedded into a metric space that the simple greedy routing algorithm is efficient to find paths between nodes when the link lengths of the network are distributed according to the power-law . Previous simulations carried out on real social network data confirmed Kleinberg's results [10] and his model was generalized to more complex models of networks [11], [12]. Other studies found very similar link length distributions in various kinds of real-world networks [10], [13]–[17]. Further studies found that networks with this kind of link length distribution are special in other aspects as well [18]–[20].
Online social networks have become a major phenomenon during the last decade, and certain service providers, like Twitter, make their data partially or completely available to the public which offers new data mining opportunities for social and network scientists. The available data have made studying many important questions possible [21]–[27] which could not be addressed before.
